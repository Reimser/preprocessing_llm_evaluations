"By . Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 12:03 EST, 26 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:34 EST, 27 March 2013 . Tragic: Gérald Babin, 25, died during the first day of filming on French reality show Koh-Lanta . One of France's most popular reality television programmes has had its latest season cancelled after a contestant died on the first day of filming. Koh-Lanta, the French version of Survivor, was filming its 16th season on a Cambodian island when Gérald Babin fell ill during a tug-of-war task with other contestants. The 25-year-old was airlifted to a nearby hospital but suffered a series of heart attacks on the way and was later pronounced dead. The tragic incident on Friday came at the very start of a planned five-month stay on the island of Koh Rong. Contestants had jumped from a boat and were taking part in a tug-of-war contest when Mr Babin started to complain about cramps in his arms. Doctors examined him on the set and decided he should be taken to hospital on the mainland town of Sihanoukville. After he suffered from multiple cardiac arrests on the helicopter journey, hospital doctors were unable to save his life. Adventure Line Productions, which produces the programme, said that Mr Babin had undergone a medical examination before being accepted as a contestant. Broadcaster TF1 said in a statement: 'The whole team from ALP and TF1, plus [presenter] Denis Brogniart, are devastated and share in the deep sadness of Gérald's family. 'All their thoughts are with his parents, sister, wife and friends.' Hit: A previous season of Koh-Lanta, one of the most popular reality TV shows in France . The companies immediately decided to suspend filming and cancel the show's current season, and the cast and crew have now returned to France. Cambodia's tourism minister said that Mr Babin's family have travelled to the country to repatriate his body. Koh-Lanta has been running on TF1 since 2001, and averaged 7.4million viewers in its latest season. It is a spin-off of Survivor, which was invented by British producer Charlie Parsons and first appeared on TV in Sweden in 1997. Tough: But all contestants are required to undergo health checks before the start of filming . The show involves 'castaways' on a remote island working together to build a camp, with the contestants nominating one person to be evicted each week. There have been dozens of different versions of Survivor - in the U.S., the 26th season is currently airing on CBS. The UK is one of the few countries where the reality contest was not a big hit, being cancelled after its second season in 2002 and replaced with I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!","Gérald Babin complained of cramps while undergoing task on Koh-Lanta .

"By . Sara Malm . Hall of Fame quarterback Jim Kelly will no longer be undergoing surgery to treat his recently returned oral cancer.

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- A nonprofit consumer group said Thursday that it will sue Bayer HealthCare, alleging ""deceptive and irresponsible"" advertising that contends selenium in two of its multivitamins may reduce men's risk of prostate cancer. One A Day Men's 50+ Advantage ads say selenium may cut men's risk of prostate cancer, a consumer group says. The Center for Science in the Public Interest said it informed the multinational company of its intent Thursday. David Schardt, the center's senior nutritionist, told reporters during a teleconference that the center already has filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission. ""We are standing behind all the claims we make in support of the products,"" Trish McKernan, Bayer's global spokeswoman, told CNN. ""The selenium claims are made by a [Food and Drug Administration]-approved qualified health claim. We regularly review the evidence, and we change our claims if necessitated. The emerging science hasn't compelled us to change our claims, and the FDA claim is intact."" Bayer's HealthCare division, based in Leverkusen, Germany, researches, manufactures and markets pharmaceutical products. Bayer promotes One A Day Men's 50+ Advantage and One A Day Men's Health Formula multivitamins on package labels, TV and radio ads and on its Web site. In its promotions, the company says ""emerging research"" suggests that selenium might reduce the risk of prostate cancer, the center said. ""Did you know that there are more new cases of prostate cancer each year than any other cancer?"" according to one radio ad. ""Now there is something you can do."" Both dietary supplements contain 105 micrograms of the trace mineral selenium per daily dose, or about twice the Recommended Daily Allowance, which is 55 micrograms a day for adults, according to the center. Visit CNNhealth.com, your connection for better living . ""It's astounding that a company such as Bayer ... would make such deceptive claims,"" the center's litigation director, Steve Gardner, told reporters during the same teleconference. Supporting the center in its letter of complaint to the FTC are nine researchers, who wrote a separate letter to Mary Engle, associate director of advertising practices. Among the signees are medical professionals from the Harvard School of Public Health, American Cancer Society and University of Illinois at Chicago Division of Pathology Research. All agree there is scant evidence to support Bayer's claim. A seven-year, $118 million study funded by the National Institutes of Health found last year that selenium does not prevent prostate cancer in healthy men, the center said. The Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial involving 35,000 U.S. and Canadian men was halted in October when researchers determined that selenium was not protecting the men from prostate cancer and may have been causing diabetes in some of them. According to the researchers in their letter supporting the FTC's complaint, ""the federally financed study was the largest individually, randomized cancer prevention trial ever conducted, and, given its high rates of adherence and its statistical power, it is unlikely to have missed detecting a benefit of even a very modest size."" ""Bayer Healthcare is doing a disservice to men by misleading them about a protective role for selenium in prostate cancer,"" they added.

"(PEOPLE.com) -- Melissa McCarthy is no longer just a bridesmaid. She's the bride. The ""Mike & Molly"" Emmy winner and ""Bridesmaids"" scene-stealer has some big plans on her plate -- from launching her own plus-size fashion line to getting hockey's prized Stanley Cup (for a movie) -- during what is already a stellar year for her. But none of her professional plans can top her favorite pastime, being mom to her two daughters with actor-husband Ben Falcone: Vivian, 4, and Georgette, 1Â½. McCarthy tells the Hollywood Reporter that being a mother actually helps her feel less insecure about her looks. ""The stupid stuff like what I wear or how I look I can't control, so I just try not to give too much energy to it,"" she says, calling her body a work in progress after giving birth to Georgette. ""At 20, I would have been like: 'Don't they like me? Was it my hair?' At 41, I think the things that define me, I hope, are a lot more than those kinds of petty things."" As for those red-carpet moments, ""Trying to find stuff that's still fashion-forward in my size is damn near impossible. It's either for like a 98-year-old woman or a 14-year-old hooker, and there is nothing in the middle,"" McCarthy wisecracks. Case in point: trying to outfit herself for the Emmys, which required sifting through ""nine million dresses with taffeta or shiny bows."" The final result was McCarthy's own line that she is co-designing with couturier Daniella Pearl. Hosting SNL This Weekend . Fans needn't fret, however -- she'll still be doing comedy, including hosting this weekend's ""Saturday Night Live."" She psyched for this, too, admitting to having an emotional reaction when the producers invited her to do it. ""I went into such an embarrassing, weird, inappropriately loud cry,"" says McCarthy. ""I'm bent over, literally, in the rug section of Living Spaces, wailing."" Also ahead: starring in and co-writing a movie with ""Bridesmaids"" scribe Annie Mumolo, which is about hijacking the Stanley Cup to cheer up her sick husband; costarring with Jason Bateman in a movie comedy (still in the talking stage); and appearing in Judd Apatow's as-yet-untitled ""Knocked Up"" spin-off -- and that, reportedly, is only for starters.

"NEW YORK (CNN) -- Former lighting technician Patrick McDermott, best known as Olivia Newton-John's boyfriend of nine years, mysteriously disappeared July 1, 2005. Olivia Newton-John and Patrick McDermott were together for nine years. Then he disappeared. He wasn't on board the fishing boat ""Freedom"" when it returned to shore in San Pedro, California, after an overnight excursion. Investigators say he'd visited Newton-John the day before with flowers, bid her farewell and ended their relationship. McDermott was seen boarding the vessel that evening with his fishing gear and a duffle bag. The 22 passengers and three crew members on board gave conflicting reports about his whereabouts both during and at the end of the trip. Police have determined that McDermott did indeed board the vessel, fished with the others and socialized on the boat both on June 30 and the next day, July 1. However, the witness accounts conflict about what happened as the boat neared shore on the afternoon of July 1. No one is quite sure when they last saw McDermott in the last 30 minutes of the voyage.  Watch why this cold case is a real mystery » . McDermott paid his bar and kitchen tab, which consisted of two hot dogs and a Coke, a kitchen receipt shows. Then he seems to have vanished. Some witnesses told police they thought they saw McDermott get off the boat when it docked and walk toward the parking lot, but they cannot be sure it was him. Ten days passed before relatives began a search for McDermott. They first became alarmed on July 6 when he didn't show up for a family gathering. Relatives found his car still parked at the San Pedro Marina where he'd left it when he boarded the fishing vessel. Investigators then discovered McDermott had left personal items on the boat, including his wallet. As police looked into his background, they learned that McDermott had been facing a mountain of debt, including being ordered by a court to pay back child support payments for his 15-year-old son from a prior marriage. A Coast Guard investigation concluded that he was ""most likely drowned at sea."" But some people believe he may be alive. Investigators have theorized that McDermott may have staged his death to escape financial pressures. Since McDermott disappeared, there have been hundreds of supposed sightings of him in Mexico. Private investigators and some police investigators speculate that McDermott may be hiding in the small village of Sayulita, 40 miles outside the resort town of Puerta Vallarta. A community of expatriates in Sayulita work as deckhands for the mega-yachts owned by billionaire South American businessmen. The Coast Guard, the lead investigative agency, says its case is closed. It found no evidence to support or disprove criminality or foul play in the McDermott disappearance. ""We spoke to dozens of witnesses on that vessel and we concluded any reported sightings of McDermott getting off that boat after it docked were not credible,"" said Scott Epperson, a Coast Guard spokesman in Long Beach. Although the investigation is officially closed, he encourages anyone with credible tips to please call the tip line at 310-521-4296.

"Public Health England forecasts that 63 per cent of men in their fifties will be obese by 2034 (file picture) Two thirds of middle-aged men will be obese within 20 years if current trends continue, a new report predicts. Public Health England (PHE) forecasts that 63 per cent of men in their fifties will be obese by 2034, and 38 per cent of women of the same age will also be overweight. Its latest report, which gives a long-term projection into the lifestyle choices which affect the nation’s health, also predicts that one in three people will be obese by 2034. At present, 62 per cent of adults in Britain are overweight or obese. The number of children who are obese doubles from reception age to Year Six. According to the report, one in ten people will develop type two diabetes due to their weight within the next two decades if current trends continue. However, if obesity levels were reduced to what they were in 1993, more than five million cases of disease could be prevented, the body said. According to the report, the nation will be 35 per cent less active in 2030 than in 1961, putting people at increased risk of type two diabetes, heart attacks, strokes, cancer and other weight-related diseases. The report also states that alcohol-related deaths have doubled over the last 20 years and alcohol and obesity are now the leading causes of liver disease - the only major disease in the UK for which mortality is still increasing. Duncan Selbie, chief executive of PHE said: ‘We have an ambition: for people of this country to live as well as possible, for as long as possible. ‘But on current trends, we are going to fall short because we face an epidemic of largely preventable long-term diseases. ‘We may be living longer, but we – and future generations – risk spending many of these extra years in poor health unless we do a better job of tackling major risks such as obesity, poor diet, physical inactivity, smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption.’ The report comes after PHE warned that the UK is now even worse than America for inactivity – with half of women and a third of men moving so little in their daily lives that they are exposing themselves to diseases earlier in life. Scroll down for video . If obesity levels continue to rise at the same rate, PHE predicts one in three will be obese by 2034 (file picture) Earlier this week, PHE confirmed that one in six deaths every year in Britain are directly due to inactivity. It equates to about 84,500 in England and Wales – a very similar number to the number of deaths attributed to smoking. It also said that 63 per cent of adults do not take the recommended amount of exercise of two and a half hours over the course of a week. This compares to 18 per cent in the Netherlands, 28 per cent in Germany, 33 per cent in France and 41 per cent in the U.S. Figures show the UK's average levels of exercise are a fifth lower than in the 1960s and the worst in the Western world.","63 per cent of men in their fifties will be obese by 2034, new report predicts .

"(CNN) -- Detroit Mayor David Bing called Tuesday's 85 fires in the city a ""natural disaster"" and defended the fire department's response. ""I have ultimate confidence in the Detroit Fire Department,"" he said at a Wednesday afternoon news conference. ""I think they've done an outstanding job."" Asked whether the department was adequately staffed or had enough equipment Tuesday, Bing said the important thing was that no one was hurt or killed. ""I don't care how much money you have. When something like this happens, all you can do is respond,"" he said. Fire Commissioner James Mack Jr. said the department is budgeted for about 500 firefighters, about 20 fewer positions than last year. About 236 firefighters fought Tuesday's fires across much of the city and took no breaks, Mack added. The inferno was a perfect storm, and was aggravated by high winds and downed power lines, the officials said. ""It just created a firestorm where we had fires,"" the fire commissioner said, adding that at least eight of the fires were linked to downed power lines and two to arson, though he said those numbers may change. He said response times might have been slow because of the volume of calls and officials having to prioritize the fires, especially if some were at vacant residences. Monday morning quarterbacking of resources is always easy to do, Mack said. ""I have to balance safety of public and the monies the department has."" CNN iReporter Joe Wilk, who recorded video of flames and their charred aftermath Tuesday and Wednesday, said that one fire spread to about 10 homes in an hour. ""It's pretty tragic. How many people just lost their houses and everything they own?"" he asked. A woman told him that firefighters didn't arrive for an hour to fight the fire, which also destroyed garages. ""A lot of these fires were due to high winds and downed wires,"" said Karen Dumas, a city spokeswoman. ""We had winds from 30 to 50 mph and have a number of downed power wires,"" Mack said. ""We are attributing some of the fires to downed power wires, which makes more fires with the wind being so strong."" Mack said that between 8 a.m. and 5:30 p.m., the fire department responded to 140 calls of wires down before the evening outbreak. Fire officials said Wednesday that there were still hot spots and downed power lines in the city. Fire departments in the neighboring towns of Warren, Dearborn and Harper Woods helped Detroit firefighters. Mack said perhaps he should have asked for help earlier. ""It's a matter of public safety,"" Dumas said.  ""We have enough resources to manage our daily demands, but that was an unusual and concentrated number of fires."" City officials say they will be communicating with DTE Energy about its response to downed power lines. Bing said he was heartened by the community response. ""I want to thank the residents who came and did what they needed to do,"" the mayor said. ""That's one of the cultural changes we are starting to see here in the city. I think our community understands we are all in this together.""","He defends fire department response, staffing .

"MPs today launched a bid for ‘Black Friday’ discounts to be scrapped to stop further ‘scenes of disorder’ as desperate shoppers fight each other for the best bargains.

It comes after shoppers an estimated £810million on Black Friday last year – November 28 – making it the biggest ever day for UK online sales. The shopping boom caused retailers to suffer their slowest December growth in six years after Black Friday spending disrupted the ‘timing and rhythm’ of Christmas sales.

"Seattle (CNN) -- Self-styled superhero Phoenix Jones unmasked himself before cameras Thursday and vowed to keep fighting crime after prosecutors delayed a decision on whether to press assault charges against him. Jones -- who told reporters his real name is Ben Fodor -- routinely patrols downtown Seattle streets decked out in a rubber suit and mask. He was arrested early Sunday on four counts of assault after police said he used pepper spray on a group of people leaving a nightclub. A spokesman for Fodor said he was trying to break up a fight. Video shot by a documentary crew and posted on Phoenix Jones' Facebook page showed a chaotic scene, with the self-styled super hero being chased by a purse-wielding woman and then shooting what appeared to be pepper spray at a group of people. Fodor was the only person arrested in the incident. Seattle Police said Fodor overreacted, and asserted that the city is not in need of vigilante crime fighters. ""If you see something that warrants calling 911, call 911. You don't need to dress up in a costume to do that,"" police spokesman Mark Jamieson said. In court Thursday, Fodor appeared wearing a hood, which a judge's assistant asked him to remove. Told charges had not been filed against him, Fodor put the rubber hood back on and left the court with a swarm of media cameras following him. Outside the courthouse, Fodor told reporters he would continue his anti-crime patrols and then removed his hood. ""In addition to being Phoenix Jones,"" he said. ""I am also Ben Fodor, a father and brother. I am just like everybody else. The only difference is that I try to stop crime."" Fodor also said he would invite the public to accompany him on future patrols. He then walked off without taking any questions from reporters. An Internet search showed Fodor has competed in mixed martial arts events, with a record of 11 wins and no losses. Kimberly Mills, a spokeswoman for the city attorney's office, said prosecutors will decide whether to file charges against him after they finish interviewing witnesses and complete the investigation into the incident Sunday.","Superhero Phoenix Jones is revealed to be the alter ego of Ben Fodor .

"By . Tom Mctague, Mailonline Deputy Political Editor . David Cameron warned EU leaders there would be 'consequences' for electing Jean-Claude Juncker president of the European Commission earlier this year and came close to threatening to walk out . David Cameron is preparing to threaten to back Britain quitting the European Union if it refuses to return sweeping powers back to Westminster. The Prime Minister has always refused to say he would campaign to sever ties if he failed to achieve his promised reforms, but is understood to now be prepared to issue the warning. Mr Cameron has pledged that a Conservative government would hold a referendum on EU membership by the end of 2017 after renegotiating Britain’s relationship with Brussels. His efforts to pave the way for a new deal were dealt a blow earlier in the summer when he lost the battle to stop Jean-Claude Juncker becoming the next European Commission president. Mr Juncker is seen as an ‘arch federalist’ in Downing Street – supporting more powers for Brussels over national Parliaments. The PM wants to Britain to be freed from the commitment to an ''ever closer union'' as well as a shift to powers flowing away from Brussels rather than to it. Among the other reforms he wants to secure are a reduction in red tape for businesses and the right to free movement to take up work, not free benefits. But critics warn that a significant overhaul is unlikely and he faces a major battle to win over Mr Juncker after publicly denouncing his candidacy. No timescale has been set for outlining the beefed up stance but the Conservative party's autumn conference is being considered, according to The Times. A source told the newspaper: ‘The shift was almost made public at the time Juncker was appointed, but that timing might have looked like petulance.’ The revelation comes after London Mayor Boris Johnson – seen by many as a future rival for the Tory leadership if Mr Cameron fails to secure a majority at the next election – called on the Prime Minister to declare he was prepared to walk away from the EU. Mr Johnson backed a report which claimed a British exit from the European Union would be better for the country than staying in an unreformed institution. Mr Cameron was furious that Britain's objections to Mr Juncker (right) - seen here receiving the Prime Minister with a high five in Brussels earlier this year - were ignored by other European leaders. He is now preparing to threaten to leave the EU if his proposed reforms are blocked . The study, by the Mayor’s economic adviser, banker Gerard Lyons, says that leaving the EU is ‘definitely a viable option’ and comes a ‘very close second’ to staying in a successfully reformed Union. He has claimed the UK could negotiate a ‘generous exit’ from the EU – giving access the European common market without the current political ties. Mr Johnson said his preferred option was to stay in a reformed EU, adding: ‘I think we can get there; but if we can't, then we have nothing to be afraid of in going for an alternative future, a Britain open not just to the rest of Europe but to the world, where we have historic ties and markets with vast potential for all the goods and services that originate in London - and will continue to do so under any circumstances.’","The Prime Minister may issue threat at next month's Tory Party conference .

"(CNN) -- A pair of suspected U.S. drone strikes killed four al Qaeda militants in Yemen as the United States maintained a heightened security alert in the country and urged all Americans to leave immediately. Security sources told CNN about the strikes but didn't offer additional details. A Yemeni official said four drone strikes have been carried out in the past 10 days. None of those killed on Tuesday were among the 25 names on the country's most-wanted list, security officials said. It is unclear whether the strikes were related to the added security alert in the country after U.S. officials intercepted a message from al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri to operatives in Yemen telling them to ""do something."" The message was sent to Nasir al-Wuhayshi, the leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the terror group's Yemeni affiliate. U.S. intelligence believes al-Wuhayshi has recently been appointed the overall terror organization's No. 2 leader. Also Tuesday, the State Department urged Americans in Yemen to leave immediately, citing terrorist activities and civil unrest. All non-emergency U.S. government personnel were also told to leave. Two U.S. military transport aircraft landed in Yemen on Tuesday to evacuate American citizens. ""In response to a request from the U.S. State Department, early this morning the U.S. Air Force transported personnel out of Sana'a, Yemen, as part of a reduction in emergency personnel,"" Pentagon press secretary George Little said in a statement. Little also said, ""The U.S. Department of Defense continues to have personnel on the ground in Yemen to support the U.S. State Department and monitor the security situation."" The UK Foreign Office also announced it had temporarily withdrawn all staff from the British embassy and would keep the facility shut until employees are able to return. Washington takes precautions . Acting on the intelligence information, the United States heightened its security stance, issuing a worldwide travel alert and closing a number of embassies and consulates over large areas of the Middle East and Africa this week. List of U.S. embassies and consulates closed this week . The State Department said the substantial security steps reflect an ""abundance of caution"" over intelligence information that indicated final planning by al Qaeda in Yemen for possible terrorist attacks on Western targets to coincide with the end of Ramadan this week. Three sources told CNN that the United States has information that members of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula are in the final stages of planning for an unspecified attack. Recent jailbreaks in Pakistan, Iraq and Libya all have the fingerprints of al Qaeda operations. Prison breaks are among reasons for heightened security . On Monday, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters that U.S. anti-terrorism efforts had decimated al Qaeda's global leadership and greatly diminished its core in Afghanistan and Pakistan, saying the threat had ""shifted to some of these affiliates, in particular AQAP."" Separately, American special forces units overseas have been on alert for the past several days awaiting a mission to attack potential al Qaeda targets if those behind the most recent terror threats against U.S. interests can be identified, a senior Obama administration official told CNN. The official declined to identify the units or their locations because of the sensitive nature of the information. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel put the units on alert last week, the official said. CNN's Barbara Starr and Hakim Almasmari contributed to this report .","NEW: UK withdraws staff from British embassy in Yemen, follows U.S. lead .

"Strutting along a hospital corridor, naked from the waist up, a jealous husband heads for the intensive care ward where his wife works. Moments after this image was captured on CCTV, drug addict Royston Jones launched a savage attack on nurse Claire Jones in front of seven critically-ill patients she was treating. The jobless thug, convinced she was having an affair, repeatedly shouted ‘die’ as he tried to strangle her. He also claimed he was carrying a grenade. Caught: CCTV footage released today by police (above) shows Royston Jones, naked from the waist-up, making his way into the hospital where he attacked wife Claire in front of seven patients she was treating . Chilling: The 39-year-old was seen wandering the halls of the Nevill Hall Hospital in Abergavenny, south Wales, before entering the ward where his wife worked. Jones shouted 'die' while strangling her . Dangerous: Jones is seen entering one of the rooms in the hospital before the vicious attack . He was described to the court as being a 'jealous, possessive and aggressive man' Her colleagues heroically managed to stop the attack, though the nurse was left unconscious. One of them hit Jones, 39, with a chair while a consultant anaesthetist was kneed in the face in the fight to rescue the nurse. Prosecutor Michael Jones told Newport Crown Court: ‘He was a jealous, possessive and aggressive man who was convinced his estranged wife was in another relationship.’ Jones arrived at Nevill Hall hospital in Abergavenny, South Wales, where he knocked his 9 stone wife to the floor and was lying on top of her. Jealous: Jones, right, was found guilty of attempted murder at Newport Crown Court today. He had become convinced his wife Claire, left outside court last week, was having an affair . Saved: An unconscious Mrs Jones was only saved after her 'heroic' colleagues at Nevill Hall Hospital in Abergavenny, south Wales, hit him with a chair and managed to drag him off . Mr Jones said: ‘He had his hands around her throat and there’s no doubt he was trying to kill her. 'Were it not for the heroic intervention of staff at that hospital, he would undoubtedly have succeeded.’ Mrs Jones was dragged into another room by staff but her husband came after her and put her in a headlock. She then blacked out. The mother of three, who had separated from Jones, said: ‘He was like a man possessed. All he said to me was “You’ve done it now.” And I said: “What have I done?”.’ She was taken to the A&E unit where she was treated for a swollen neck and throat, elbow and back injuries. She later told police that she was not in a relationship when she was attacked. Hospital porters managed to restrain Jones before police arrived to handcuff him. He told officers: ‘I’ll do two years for this. The court better not let me out or I’ll finish the job.’ Jones, of Brynmawr, Gwent, had a history of drug abuse – and had taken drugs that day. He was convicted of attempted murder and remanded in custody. He will be sentenced on February 20.","Rhyston Jones, naked from waist up, was captured on hospital cameras .

"PARIS, France (CNN) -- Debris from Air France 447, which crashed en route from Brazil to France last month, killing 228 people, has arrived in France, the French air accident investigation agency BEA said Wednesday. Searchers have discovered hundreds of pieces of wreckage from Air France Flight 447. ""The debris ... will be sent to Toulouse where they will be examined at the Center of Aeronautics Tests of Toulouse (a branch of the Defense Ministry) under the control of the police and the BEA investigators,"" said the French air accident investigation agency BEA. The wreckage was transported to France from Brazil by the ship ""La Ville de Bordeaux,"" according to the plane's manufacturer Airbus. It will be taken overland to Toulouse by truck. Flight 447 went down in the Atlantic Ocean in stormy weather as if flew from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris, France on June 1. Only 51 bodies were recovered, and the search is ongoing for the cause of the crash. The search for the data and voice recorders from the plane entered a second phase last week, according to France's accident investigation agency. The flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder -- commonly known as ""black boxes"" -- stop giving out acoustic broadcasts after 30 days. But investigators decided to continue listening for the ""pings"" for another 10 days after that. On July 10, two U.S. naval vessels and the French Navy submarine called off their search for the recorders, which investigators hope will shed light on exactly how and why the plane crashed. The second phase of the search will involve France's oceanographic ship ""Pourquoi Pas?"" which carries specialized exploration and intervention vehicles, according to the BEA. The French vessel will conduct new searches using diving equipment and towed sonar, the BEA said. Finding the recorders is of ""capital importance"" and ""no effort must be spared in achieving this end,"" Air France has said. ""We want to stress that for the sake of the families, we hope that the search for the black boxes will be successful,"" an Air France representative told CNN. The crash was the worst in Air France's 75-year history. Earlier this month, investigators revealed that the plane bellyflopped intact into the Atlantic Ocean. Investigator Alain Bouillard said it was still not clear what caused the crash. The mountainous ocean floor in the search area ranges from 3,280 to 15,091 feet, BEA officials have said in the past, making the search for the recorders -- and the rest of the plane's debris -- difficult. ""It is as if it fell in the Andes (mountains),"" Olivier Ferrante, chief of the BEA search mission said. Brazil called off the search for bodies on June 27, having found 51 of the 228 people who died, according to the military. Investigators have also found more than 600 parts and structural components of the plane, along with luggage, Bouillard said.","Debris from Air France 447, which crashed last month, has arrived in France .

"A hiker exploring Chile's natural wonders got the shock of his life on Wednesday afternoon when a volcano erupted before his eyes. A man identified as Walter Witt on YouTube was casually filming a serene forest with gentle waterfalls a short distance away from the foot of the 6,500-foot-high Calbuco volcano. Since being posted online the video has over 72,000 views. 'There aren't many people here,' the hiker says in Spanish in the video. 'Beautiful, the volcano there...'he says just before the volcano begins to blow. Scroll down for video . Nothing to see here: This hiker's surroundings are serene up until the moment a volcano erupts before his eyes and he runs for the hills . 'Wow,' he then says with shock as he pics up his camera and travels as far away from the erupting volcano as he possibly can. The Volcano has been dormant since 1972 and neither scientists nor government officials predicted the eruption, reports Mashable. Volcano Calbuco, believed to be among the three most dangerous of Chile's 90 active volcanoes, had erupted for the first time at 6pm local time on Wednesday. An estimated 1,500 people were forced to flee the nearby town of Ensenada after the eruption, while several smaller townships were also cleared. Locals described an apocalyptic scene as ash clouds were shot six miles into the air creating an incredible display of lightning and lava against the night's sky. Another unexpected eruption in the Los Lagos Region  heightened fears of local waters becoming contaminated, residents developing severe breathing problems and more flights being grounded. 'Beautiful volcano': The hikers speaks about the volcano's natural beauty just seconds before it erupts . The ash covered cars and houses in cities as far as 18 miles away from the source of the eruption as another massive evacuation effort gets underway. Previous and equally violent eruptions at Calbuco have continued for up to a week, according to a volcanologist from Oxford University who told Dailymail.com it is impossible to predict what will happen next. The volcano is located near the tourist town of Puerto Varas and the city of Puerto Montt, a little more than 620 miles south of Chile's capital, Santiago. The National Mining and Geology Service issued a high alert, setting up an exclusion zone of 12.5miles around the volcano, barring access to the area. Trevor Moffat, who lives in Ensenada, some six miles from the volcano, said the eruption happened without warning. Volcano Calbuco's last major eruption happened in 1961, with a weak eruption following in 1972. He said: 'It sounded like a big tractor trailer passing by the road, rattling and shaking, guttural rumbling ... we left everything there, grabbed my kid, my dog, got in the car with my wife. Mr Moffat, who was originally born in Canada, said he was now driving his family to Puerto Varas. He added: 'All the neighbors were outside, a lot of young people crying. Armageddon type reaction.' 'Wow': The hiker expresses his amazement at the volcanic eruption before quickly traveling to safe territory .

"Russia's Ekaterina Makarova reached her second successive grand slam semi-final on Tuesday, defeating third seed Simona Halep in straight sets in the Australian Open. Makarova, who lost to eventual winner Serena Williams in the last four of the US Open last year, needed just 69 minutes to overpower Halep 6-4, 6-0 in the day's first quarter-final on Rod Laver Arena. Neither player had lost a set in the previous four rounds but it was Makarova who always looked the most likely winner, racing into a 3-0 lead with two breaks of serve as Halep committed a string of unforced errors. Ekaterina Makarova celebrates beating Simona Halep and booking her spot in the semi-finals . Halep was blown away in the second set and was beaten 6-4, 6-0 . The 23-year-old Romanian did recover one of the breaks to register her first game and held to trail 2-4, but could not find another breakthrough as Makarova made the most of her swinging left-handed serve. The No 11 seed Makarova, 26, then cruised through the second set to set up a semi-final with either second seed Maria Sharapova or seventh seed Eugenie Bouchard. Makarova was in dominant form as she blasted her way into the semi-finals in 69 minutes . Halep had no answers as she was comprehensively beaten by Makarova . 'It's a great feeling, I'm so happy that I came through,' Makarova said in an on-court interview. 'She is a tough opponent and I lost to her (in their only previous meeting) two years ago. She never gives up, she is always fighting and every point is long. 'It was really tough and I am happy that I stayed solid and in my game.

Makarova looks happy as she signs autographs for fans at the end of her quarter final . Halep admitted she lost belief in the second set, adding: 'I practised very well in the morning, but maybe I was a little bit too stressed before I started the match. I had a bad day but she played well and everything was in for her so she deserves to win. 'I'm really sad a little bit now that I could not play my tennis, my game, but that's tennis and I have to look forward to the next tournament. 'I cannot say (it was) pressure. Just I was a little bit stressed. I don't know why. I had experience from last year of playing quarter-finals, so it doesn't mean that I felt pressure. 'But sometimes you cannot manage the situation, just mentally because during the points maybe I didn't fight very well today. I just lost my concentration to win the points, to win the match.

"By . Rob Waugh . Last updated at 12:03 PM on 16th November 2011 . Apple CEO Steve Jobs unveils the first-generation iPod Nano: Now Apple says models released six years ago may have a battery malfunction - and is offering free, new replacements to owners . It's one of the oddest product recalls in some time. Apple has warned that the batteries on the iPod Nano can catch fire - but only on the very oldest models. One might imagine that a Nano that has stood the test of time since 2005-2006 when the first generation of the slim devices was on sale would be safe - but Apple thinks not. The defect discovered in the batteries appears to get worse over time. So much so, in fact, that the company is offering a replacement, new iPod Nano - a serious technological upgrade which adds a touchscreen, an FM radio and a pedometer to the rather basic Nano that late Apple CEO Steve Jobs launched six years ago. All you have to do is remember where you put your six-year-old MP3 player. It's not clear what incident sparked the current recal. There have been unconfirmed and highly isolated reports of batteries overheating around the world, including incidents where overheating batteries set fire to users' clothes. But it's not exactly an epidemic. In a statement, the company said that,'Apple has determined that, in very rare cases, the battery in the iPod nano (1st generation) may overheat and pose a safety risk. Affected iPod nanos were sold between September 2005 and December 2006.' 'This issue has been traced to a single battery supplier that produced batteries with a manufacturing defect. While the possibility of an incident is rare, the likelihood increases as the battery ages.' What you get: The replacement iPod Nano is a new model that can clip to a watch strap, and also features a colour touchscreen, FM radio and pedometer . 'Apple recommends that you stop using your iPod nano (1st gen) and follow the process noted below to order a replacement unit, free of charge.' Apple says serial numbers will be checked to ensure the units are affected - you can check via their website. Replacements will be issued within six weeks.","Affected models sold between September 2005 and December 2006 .

"It's a big nation that can take a long hard look at itself and reach the conclusion it might be a bit rude toward tourists. France, which regularly tops lists of countries that are surly to travelers, appears to be waking up to the notion this might not actually be good for business. While not exactly prompting a full-blown existential crisis, the admission does seem to have led to discussions on how to make its boulevards and brasseries more inviting. ""We must rediscover the meaning of hospitality,"" Innovation Minister Fleur Pellerin told a tourism conference last week. ""Everyone recognizes we can do better on the welcome and quality of service."" This won't be news to anyone who's visited Paris in recent years and received Gallic shrugs of indifference from waiters or hoteliers. Neither is it the first time that France has done some soul searching about its attitudes. Targeted by pickpockets . Last year Parisian tourism and trade officials launched a manual offering advice to service industry employees on how to befriend the various nationalities that flock to the city. Problems apparently persist -- not helped by a 2013 crime wave in which crowds of Chinese tourists were reportedly targeted by pickpockets. A six-day strike by French air traffic controllers that's expected to create major delays for travelers this week is also unlikely to burnish the nation's image. Pellerin said France mustn't ""rest on its laurels"" at a time when the country badly needs the annual $16 billion injection that tourism provides to its economy. Her comments came as Laurent Fabius, France's foreign minister, said in an interview that he wants to push through new measures to attract visitors. He told BFMTV that he was involved with discussions to ease France's restrictive Sunday trading laws to open up more shops in Paris. Fabius said he hopes improved road and rail links between the capital and Charles de Gaulle Airport will also improve matters. As might a drive to encourage more tourism industry workers to learn other languages. Shifting attitudes . Fabius said it's ""essential"" that people understand that any tourist ""whether French or foreign -- is someone we should welcome."" Some, however, say that France is at least making progress. ""I think that, on the whole, French attitudes have shifted and that French people are more courteous with tourists than they used to be,"" French commentator and journalist Agnes Poirier told CNN. ""They are also more likely to be able to speak English and give indications. ""It is difficult for Parisians to simply ignore tourists. They know tourists spend a lot, and are a vital element of the country's prosperity, and should therefore be well treated.""","French ministers say their country could try harder to welcome visitors .

"Dallas Animal Services has sparked outrage  after putting down four dogs earlier this year, dogs that members of the community say were handed over by their owner in hopes that they would find new homes. On December 30, 27 dogs were taken from a potential animal hoarder by the shelter with the permission of the owner and, according to reports, it was agreed that they would be kept until homes could be found for them. On New Year's Day however, four of the animals were euthanized. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Four dogs (onse above) were euthanized by Dallas Animal Services on New Year's Day . Big haul: The four (one above) were part of 27 brought in in hopes of finding new homes before the winter weather set in . Deeply upset: Marina Tarashevska (above) is one of the women who helped get the animals from the owner to the shelter with the promise that homes would be found . 'These dogs just looked at us like, ""Please help."" And so we were trying to help them,' Deborah Whittington, who worked with fellow resident Marina Tarashevska on rescuing the dogs, told NBC 5. She said that the dogs were supposed to spend 10 days in the shelter while they tried to find homes for the animals before they would consider putting them down, something that a worker there assured them of when they were brought in. 'I don't think that the left hand always knows what the right hand is doing, and I feel like they have betrayed the trust of the community,' said Whittington. Sana Syed, public information director for the City of Dallas, said the workers at Animal Servies are just as upset about what has happened. 'To know that four dogs may have been euthanized in error has devastated staff, and they are also eager to look for ways to prevent incidents like this in the future,' she said in a statement. Angry: Deborah Whittington (above) who also worked on the rescue team says she is frustrated with the shelter .

"SEOUL, South Korea (CNN)  -- South Korea will open its market to most U.S. beef, a senior government official said Thursday, according to state media. Thousands of people have taken to the streets of the South Korean capital in protest at the deal . South Korea banned imports of U.S. beef in 2003 amid concerns over a case of mad cow disease in the United States. The ban closed what was then the third-largest market for U.S. beef exporters. It resumed limited imports last year -- allowing boneless beef from cattle under 30 months of age -- but that re-opening was subject to interruptions and closed altogether in October 2007. A deal that South Korea and the United States struck last month bans the import of high-risk materials, like tonsils, brains, spinal cord marrow and a section of the small intestine, Agriculture Minister Chung Woon-chun said Thursday, according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency. These parts pose the greatest risk of transmitting mad cow disease to humans. The ban will be lifted within a few days, once the government's new import rules have been published. The pending resumption of U.S. beef imports hasn't been without political costs for President Lee Myung-bak. He apologized to the nation last week for failing to fully understand concerns about mad cow disease. In downtown Seoul, thousands of people have regularly staged protests, chanting ""We don't want crazy cows,"" since the deal to revive beef imports was announced. And the main opposition party has taken up the fight. ""We will be forced to make a critical decision if the government pushes through its plan to announce resumption of beef imports,"" said Sohn Hak-kyu, leader of the main opposition United Democratic Party, Yonhap reported. ""If the government and the ruling party ignore this warning, we will come up with every possible measure to stop them."" The opposition has already filed a suit to suspend implementation of new beef import terms, according to Yonhap. Lee's ruling Grand National Party (GNP) is working to soothe tensions, saying that American beef is safe to eat and that adequate safety precautions have been taken. ""The government has tried its best to free the public from unnecessary concerns, and sufficient countermeasures have been prepared,"" said Lee Hahn-koo, the party's chief policymaker, Yonhap reported. When South Korea and the United States reached the deal in April to re-open the South Korean market, they removed the major obstacle to U.S. congressional approval of the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (FTA). Lee urged the National Assembly this month to ratify the agreement as soon as possible to provide fresh impetus to the sluggish Korean economy, saying it will create 300,000 jobs. But the opposition has promised to fight the FTA until the beef pact is nullified. In 2003, the United States exported $815 million pounds of beef and beef variety meats to South Korea. The U.S. beef industry has lost up to $4 billion since the market closed, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation.","South Korea to open market to most U.S. beef says government official .

"By . Chris Kitching . Brits who are heading abroad on their summer holidays may want to think twice about taking in the sights on a motorbike. That’s because a motorbike accident can lead to the most expensive injury claims – with the average medical bill topping £7,000 – for those who didn’t plan ahead and purchase a suitable travel insurance policy. A cycling accident (£6,262) and tripping on stairs (£2,422) are the second and third most expensive holiday mishaps, according to a study by TravelSupermarket. Incredibly risky: A quarter of Brits are travelling abroad without the protection of travel insurance . Released at the height of the summer travel season, the ‘holiday injury index’ calculated and compared healthcare costs for common injury claims in six popular destinations – Spain, Greece/Cyprus, Turkey, Egypt, Thailand and US/Canada. Of the five most expensive injuries, falling in a bathroom ranked fourth (£2,071) and slipping by the pool was fifth (£1,547). Holidaymakers will want to take care if they are riding a bicycle in North America. Uninsured Brits can face sky-high healthcare costs if they are injured in a cycling accident in the US or Canada . Falling off a bike in the US or Canada could result in painful medical bills of more than £18,000 – almost 18 times more than the same accident in Greece or Cyprus, the study found. If you’re bitten by an animal, it's best if it doesn’t occur in Spain. Medical treatment for a bite – one of the cheapest injuries to treat – is three times more expensive in Spain than it is in Turkey. There is some good news if you’re injured by broken glass in Thailand. That’s because you will spend 20 per cent less on medical costs than you would for the same injury in Greece or Cyprus. Holiday pain: An injury sustained in a fall in the bathroom costs an average of £2,071 in medical costs . Read the fine print: Analyse your travel insurance policy closely so that you know exactly what it covers . Bob Atkinson, travel expert at TravelSupermarket, said a quarter of Brits take the ‘incredibly risky’ step of travelling abroad without insurance. Many aren’t aware that when they travel within Europe the EHIC card only guarantees they will receive the same level of care as locals within the country they are visiting, Atkinson said. The level of care could be less comprehensive than the care they would receive in the UK. Atkinson said: ‘Without a travel insurance policy, you may end up having to pay for treatment with no possibility of recovering costs. ‘It’s really important that you pick the right travel insurance policy to suit your needs, whether you will be relaxing on a beach with a group of friends or going on a family holiday.’ He added: ‘Make sure that you don’t fall into the trap of thinking that you don’t need to get travel insurance if you are lying by a pool for a week, as you could be faced with high costs if you cut yourself on broken glass or slip in the bathroom after a day in the sun.’","Medical bills for a cycling accident in the US or Canada could top £18,000 .

"(CNN) -- Day-long clashes between police and rioters marked a controversial holiday march in Northern Ireland, leaving dozens of officers injured and widespread damage in Belfast. The violence began overnight, on the eve of July 12, known as ""The Twelfth"" by Protestants who march to celebrate the victory of English king William III over his ousted Catholic predecessor James II in 1689. More than 100 riot police removed Catholic protesters from a road in north Belfast to allow the march to take place, journalist Peter Taggart told CNN Monday. Rioters pelted police with Molotov cocktails and other explosives, and officers fired baton rounds and used water cannon in attempts to break up the crowds, police said. A policewoman was struck in the head by an object thrown at her, and ambulance crews who rushed to the scene were confronted by rioters, police said. Her condition was unknown. Several vehicles were carjacked and set afire, police said. Police have not yet released details of the number of arrests made, or the number of people injured. However, authorities earlier in the day reported that at least 27 police officers were injured in the clashes. The injuries are not thought to be serious, police spokesman John Anderson had said. The violence took place in two different parts of the city on the eve of a holiday often marked by tension between Catholics and Protestants. Tensions in Northern Ireland as marching season begins . The disruption began minutes before the start of the holiday -- also known as ""Orangeman's Day."" Because of the sectarian nature of the holiday, celebrations have sometimes been marred by violence in the past. ""This is utterly wrong and I condemn it in the strongest possible terms,"" police district Chief Superintendent Mark Hamilton said in a statement early Monday. ""Those involved in tonight's violence were intent on causing mayhem and destruction."" Hamilton said police were investigating the incident. ""We have appealed for calm in the run up to the Twelfth of July and we continue to do so,"" he said. ""We would appeal to anyone with influence in the community to exert it to ensure that the next few days pass off without incident."" On Saturday, police in Northern Ireland said a roadside bomb that exploded in a border caused significant damage to both a road and a nearby bridge. District Cmdr. Chief Alasdair Robinson said he believed that police officers were the target, and that the bomb was placed in the area in an attempt to injure or kill them.","Rioters attack police on historic Protestant holiday .

"(CNN) -- A New York man accused of stalking and threatening to kill two nationally known TV anchorwomen has been arrested, authorities said Monday. David Lee Simpson, 48, was arrested in Bath, New York. He has waived extradition and will be taken to the Maricopa County Jail in Arizona this week, according to a statement from the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office. He was indicted by a grand jury in Phoenix last week on charges of stalking and computer tampering, it said. It was not immediately clear whether he had retained representation. The statement did not identify the two TV personalities, who were allegedly targeted because of their coverage of the Jodi Arias trial. When asked who they were, spokesman Joaquin Enriquez said: ""The sheriff said he would not release the names per Turner."" CNN, a division of Turner Broadcasting System, is not commenting on the case. Arias was convicted in May of first-degree murder for killing her ex-boyfriend, Travis Alexander. A jury deadlocked on whether she should be sentenced to death. Simpson purportedly made threats on Twitter before and after the trial. He threatened to tie the anchorwomen to a ""tree naked and leave them to suffer all night"" and then ""slit their throats,"" according to the Sheriff's Office statement. He also allegedly threatened a Phoenix woman who defended the anchorwomen on Twitter. ""Threats against anyone have to be taken seriously,"" said Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. ""Media personalities are frequent targets and because of their high visibility, they are particularly vulnerable. A few in the past have been stalked and murdered. ""The suspect was on his way south with enough weapons in his car to do serious harm to someone. Fortunately, we acted quickly and in so doing, were able to stop him before anything could transpire."" A search of Simpson's car turned up several guns, shotgun ammunition, handcuffs, zip-ties, binoculars, a knife and a police radio, the Sheriff's Office said. A receipt to a recently purchased shotgun was also found but the shotgun itself was not.

"Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has opened up about his management style, using the analogy of making a suit to measure to describe his role, whilst also suggesting being a coach in England is ‘paradise’. The Blues boss, since returning to Chelsea in the summer of 2013, has assembled a star studded squad which is perched at the top of the Premier League and in the last 16 of the Champions League. Mourinho, who has won league titles in Portugal, Spain and Italy, insists you need to treat each player differently to harness their potential. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho talks to Sports Illustrated about his reign at Stamford Bridge . ‘To manage a player is like to make a suit by measure, because all of them are different I cannot go to a shop and buy some 38, some 40, some 42, some 44 and arrive in the dressing room. No. It has to be by measure, it has to be perfect,’ Mourinho told Sports Illustrated. ‘So the personal relationship with the players is something very very important. Obviously there is also the collective leadership and I have to try and adapt my collective leadership to the profile of group I have,’ added the Blues boss. ‘But I think the suit by measure is the perfect way to explain what I think is fundamental – every man is a man, I read them and the better I can interact with them the better the team can be.’ Mourinho watches on as his new recruit Juan Cuadrado (centre) control the ball at Stamford Bridge . Mourinho told Grant Wahl Chelsea have been a success in the transfer market because they don't panic . Chelsea had a strong summer in the transfer market with the acquisitions of Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas and Nemanja Matic proving excellent additions and have propelled the Blues to the top of the Premier League. The 52-year-old puts his transfer success down to composure and research: . ‘First of all we didn’t panic. I came here in the first season (2013-14) and we decided not to buy just because we want to win desperately,’ added Mourinho. ‘If we have to wait one year ok, to be more sure about the profile of the type of player we want to bring. We had to be very sure of what we wanted to do. ‘After that it’s a lot easier not to make mistakes, analyse everything, try everything, know the players deeply, know if the players have the potential to improve or not under your guidance. Chelsea's midfielder Cesc Fabregas, a £30m summer signing, has been in fine form so far this season . ‘So when the summer market arrived we were in a great condition to make the right decisions to improve our team. Mourinho is clearly relishing life back in London despite disputes with officials and an apparent ‘campaign’ against his Chelsea side. ‘Firstly it’s paradise for the social life, In Europe the power of football made our lives complicated and in England people look at you in a normal way. You can walk in the street, shop with your family, go to a restaurant,’ said the Portuguese. ‘The social life is much more relaxed. There is an expression in England that the passion for the game lasts 90 minutes a week and after that everything is calm.’ The 52-year-old returned to the 'paradise' of coaching in  West London in the summer of 2013 .","Chelsea are currently top of the Premier League by five points .

"By . Graham Smith . PUBLISHED: . 11:01 EST, 28 May 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 11:02 EST, 28 May 2012 . A mother has given birth to twins just two years after she was told cancer treatment would leave her infertile. Clair Sudron, 32, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2010 and had successful surgery at Hartlepool Hospital to remove a lump. She then underwent four courses of chemotherapy to kill any remaining cancerous cells. But doctors warned her that she would likely to be left infertile and faced the heart-wrenching possibility of never having a family in the future. 'Fantastic': Clair Sudron, 32, has given birth to twins Bella and Scarlett just two years after she was told cancer treatment would leave her infertile . Yet just over a year later, the sales assistant discovered she was carrying twins. And seven weeks ago she gave birth to daughters Bella and Scarlett Herring, who were both given a clean bill of health. Miss Sudron, of Hartlepool, County Durham, discovered her lump early on, which resulted in medics being able to save her life. She is now encouraging others to go for a check-up if they have any doubts whatsoever. Miss Sudron, who lives with partner Steven Herring, said: 'I can’t really describe that moment when you are told you have cancer. 'The surgeon said to me he couldn’t believe I had breast cancer, I was young, didn’t smoke, wasn’t overweight and looked after myself. 'I suppose I did fear the worst, there were times where I was sat there thinking ""God, I’m going to be dead in six months.”' Twin sisters: Babies Scarlett (left) and Bella Herring have both been given a clean bill of health . Happy family: Miss Sudron and her partner Steven Herring are now experiencing the joys of parenthood . Miss Sudron was relieved when medics revealed that the cancer had not spread to lymph nodes around the body and surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy was successful. Then in August last year, she realised that she was pregnant. She said: 'I had all of the symptoms of being pregnant but to be honest I thought it was the chemotherapy, it really messes all of your systems up. 'But I did a few tests and they were all positive. I remember ringing my family and telling them I was going round to speak to them, they all thought I was going to tell them the cancer had came back.' Miss Sudron was told she was carrying twins in a routine nine-week scan. She said: 'I had always wanted to have kids but I just figured I was going to have to have get used to the idea of not being able to. 'To find out I was pregnant and then to find out I was going to have twins was fantastic, absolutely fantastic.' The pregnancy went to plan and Bella and Scarlett are now at home with their parents.

"By . Associated Press . An American soldier blinded in Afghanistan and the widow of another soldier killed there have filed a $44.7 million wrongful death and injury lawsuit against a Canadian man who was held at Guantanamo Bay and pleaded guilty to committing war crimes when he was 15. Layne Morris of Utah and Tabitha Speer of North Carolina filed their lawsuit Friday in federal court in Utah against Omar Khadr, who signed a plea deal in 2010 that he committed five war crimes, including the killing of U.S. soldier Christopher Speer, in 2002. As part of the deal, Khadr admitted to throwing the grenade that killed Speer and injured other soldiers, including Morris, who lost sight in one eye from the shrapnel, the lawsuit states. The Toronto-born Khadr is serving the remainder of his eight-year sentence in Canada. Lawsuit: In this file photo, Tabitha Speer, widow of Sgt. 1st Class Chris Speer, is seen next to former sergeant Layne Morris . Morris and Tabitha Speer are concerned that Khadr might get his hands on money from a $20 million wrongful imprisonment lawsuit he filed against the Canadian government, said Don Winder, a Salt Lake City-based attorney who is representing them. 'We don't know if he'll ever have any money, but we need to make sure that we're doing the right thing and the principles are right,' Winder said, noting that Morris is dealing with his injuries and Tabitha Speer is raising two children without any income from her husband. The lawsuit seeks damages for Speer's wrongful death and distress to Speer for suffering from his injuries before dying, in addition to damages for Morris and his wife. It wasn't immediately clear if any similar lawsuits have been filed against other detainees at Guantanamo, the U.S. naval base in Cuba. Prisoner: Omar Khadr, seen in this file artists' rendering, pleaded guilty to committing five war crimes when he was 15 . Widow: In this file photo, Tabitha Speer, widow of Sgt. 1st Class Chris Speer,  speaks to reporters on the sentencing of Khadr at his military commission at Guantanamo Bay . It's unclear if Khadr has an attorney in the Utah lawsuit. Dennis Edney, a Canadian attorney who has represented Khadr, did not return messages from The Associated Press. He has said the facts of the plea deal are false and Khadr signed it so he could return to Canada. Khadr's military trial drew criticism because he was captured at age 15 and seriously wounded during a four-hour battle at an Afghanistan al-Qaida compound in 2002. Khadr's lawyers and human rights groups contended he was groomed to be 'child soldier' and should have been sent home for rehabilitation. They said Speer died in a battlefield killing that did not amount to a war crime. Khadr was prohibited under the deal from calling witnesses at his sentencing hearing who would support defense claims that he was a 'child soldier,' forced into fighting the U.S. by a radical father who was an associate of Osama bin Laden. 'The fact that the trial of a child soldier, Omar Khadr, has ended with a guilty plea in exchange for his eventual release to Canada does not change the fact that fundamental principles of law and due process were long since abandoned in Omar's case,' Edney said in 2010. Military prosecutors in the case portrayed Khadr as a dangerous terrorist. Khadr spent 10 years at Guantanamo, and was transferred to Canada in 2012 to serve the remainder of his sentence.","Layne Morris of Utah and Tabitha Speer of North Carolina filed their lawsuit in federal court in Utah against Omar Khadr .

"A dog needed life-saving treatment after she chewed the cap off a bottle of Baileys and drank the lot. Six-year-old German Shepherd cross Molly was found crumpled in a heap by her owners at their home in Folkestone, Kent, after she guzzled a litre of the creamy liqueur. The owners, who asked not to be named, said they had taken Molly on her morning walk before leaving her in the house for 'a short period of time'. Feeling ruff: Molly with vet nurse Andi Mills (in green) and vet Stephanie Hughes (blue) after she recovered from alcohol poisoning caused by downing an entire bottle of Baileys liqueur while her owners were out . When they returned they found Molly barely conscious and suffering fits as she struggled to breathe. At the time, Molly's owners had no idea what was wrong and rushed her to the vet, where she was put under general anaesthetic to stop any further seizures. It was only when Molly's owners returned home they found a entire one-litre bottle of Baileys - which has an ABV of 17 per cent - empty in the living room. Molly had chewed the cap of the bottle, which was full and had not previously been opened, and proceeded to glug every last drop. Vet Jane Lewis, who helped save Molly's life at Manor Vets in Folkestone, said the dog was lucky to be alive after being treated for alcohol poisoning. She said Molly was taken to a specialist unit for overnight care last Monday, the day she was admitted, and started to make a full recovery by the end of last week.

"The chairman of the Essendon Football Club, Paul Little, has finally sold his Queensland home after putting it on the market in 2011.

"An asylum seeker is pictured with his lips sewn together in this handout picture provided by the refugee action coalition, taken inside the Manus Island detention centre on January 13 . Two-thirds of asylum seekers at Manus Island are on hunger strike and up to 14 people have sewn their lips together to protest against a plan to move them to Papua New Guinea. Asylum seekers began hunger strikes last week at the Australian-run asylum-seeker processing centre, demanding the immigration department halt a scheduled January 22 transfer of 50 male detainees to temporary, insecure housing in Lorengau, the Manus capital. Up to 700 people have been refusing to eat and in some cases drink in the protests that have been escalating over the past week, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. Asylum seekers have also written to Manus Island service providers asking that their organs be donated should they die in detention. 'As you see, hunger strike spreads all over the center and everyday more and more of us become unconsciousness and faint. This means we are entering a critical phase in our medical status,' the letter reads. 'All asylum seekers on Manus Island in hunger strike ask you to hand over our medical records to organ donation organisation in case of our fatalities inside the cage. 'This way at least a part of us may one day feel sweet taste of FREEDOM.' Immigration Minister Peter Dutton has said the situation was volatile and urged those involved to refrain from self harm. Refugee advocates said riot officers raided one compound in the early hours of Sunday, seizing ring leaders and placing them in isolation to stop the protest. Scroll down for video .

"(CNN)The U.S. Army has agreed to provide hormone therapy for Chelsea Manning, the soldier serving a 35-year prison sentence for leaking a huge trove of classified documents. The prisoner formerly known as Bradley Manning, and once held to be male, said in August 2013, the day after her court sentencing, that she is female. Just over a year later, it emerged that she had filed a lawsuit in federal court claiming she ""has been denied access to medically necessary treatment"" for her gender disorder. The commandant of the Fort Leavenworth Disciplinary Barracks in Kansas, where Manning is serving her sentence, issued a memo on February 5 authorizing the addition of hormone therapy to Manning's treatment, USA Today reported Thursday. The memo cited a recommendation that the therapy was ""medically appropriate and necessary."" The news was welcomed by Manning's legal counsel in the lawsuit. ""We are thrilled for Chelsea that the government has finally agreed to initiate hormone therapy as part of her treatment plan,"" said Chase Strangio, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union. ""This is an important first step in Chelsea's treatment regimen and one that is in line with the recommendations of all of her doctors and the basic requirements of the Eighth Amendment."" But Strangio said that the approval of the therapy was only a partial victory. ""The military continues to refuse to let Chelsea grow her hair like other female prisoners, a critical part of her treatment plan that has been recognized by her doctors,"" he said. Also, the delay in getting the hormone treatment ""came with a significant cost to Chelsea and her mental health,"" Strangio said. At the time of her 2013 announcement that she planned to live as a woman, Manning asked for support and said she wanted to begin hormone therapy as soon as possible. Manning said she was diagnosed in 2010 with gender dysphoria, which her lawyers describe as ""the medical diagnosis given to individuals whose gender identity -- their innate sense of being male or female -- differs from the sex they were assigned at birth, causing clinically significant distress."" A Kansas judge in April granted the former Army intelligence analyst's request to formally be known as Chelsea Elizabeth Manning. She was convicted last year of stealing and disseminating 750,000 pages of documents and videos to WikiLeaks in what has been described as the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history. Manning was found guilty of 20 of the 22 charges against her, including violations of the U.S. Espionage Act. CNN's Ross Levitt contributed to this report.","""This is an important first step in Chelsea's treatment regimen,"" her legal counsel says .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Hong Kong's billionaire properties are the most expensive in the world, according to global real estate firm, Savills. ""Ultra-prime"" properties in Hong Kong cost £7,200 per square foot ($10,880) on average, Savills said in its latest World Cities Review report, which compares property prices for top luxury homes. Other Asia Pacific cities dominated the ranking, with Tokyo, Shanghai, Singapore, Mumbai and Sydney all among the top 10 most expensive cities to buy luxury property in 2012. Real estate values worldwide doubled in the last seven years, with large increases seen in China and Asia, thanks to the emergence of new wealthy classes and rising commodity prices, the report said. Singapore and Mumbai experienced the highest growth in property prices since 2005, with a growth of 232% and 176%, respectively. Tokyo had the slowest growth at 8%. ""The activity of billionaires in international real estate markets reflects the creation of global wealth and the economic success of particular regions and cities,"" the report said.

New York stands out among world cities as ""particularly good value"" for residential properties, ""especially from an income return point of view,"" according to the report.

""Only London's ultra-prime market stands out among the 'old world' cities as having shown significant growth since 2005, totaling 107%,"" the report said. Real estate costs for businesses are cheapest in Mumbai, with Sydney offering the best value for money. ""We may well see Sydney becoming an increasingly global city as it proves attractive to new and expanding business on the Pacific Rim,"" the report said. But restrictions on foreign buyers to purchase homes remain an obstacle, according to Savills. READ MORE: Report reveals where world's richest live .

In 2012, Singapore's growth slowed to 5%, Hong Kong's growth stalled in the second half of the year, and London slowed noticeably in the second half, Savills noted. Paris saw a drop in billionaire property values, but remains the fourth most expensive city overall for top-end homes, at an average price of £2,900 per square foot ($4,383).

The report also looked at leisure resort areas -- like Cap Ferrat in France, Alibag in India and Phuket, Thailand -- which lag in values compared to urban properties but have the most potential for growth, according to Savills.

"(CNN) -- A Florida mother shot her four children early Tuesday morning before turning the gun on herself at her home in Port St. John, police said. A neighbor heard shots at 4:50 a.m. and then responded to a knock at the door to find three of the children, police said. The three children went to the neighbor's house to say their mother had shot them, Brevard County Sheriff's Office Lt. Tod Goodyear said, according to CNN affiliate WKMG. The mother, Tonya Thomas, 33, then called them back home, Brevard County Sheriff's Office Lt. Tod Goodyear told reporters. The mother then shot them again, killing them, Goodyear said, according to WKMG. ""I'm a father and I've got kids. I cannot comprehend a person doing that to their child -- calling them back to the slaughter,"" Goodyear said, according to WKMG. Responding deputies arrived at the house and heard shots.

"The death threats, Mary Willingham expected. More shocking is that the University of North Carolina is now disavowing her research as a whistle-blower -- research that showed between 8% and 10% of the school's football and basketball players are reading below a third-grade level. UNC issued a statement Wednesday night saying it did not believe Willingham's account of a basketball player who could not read or write. It went on: ""University officials can't comment on the other statistical claims mentioned in the story because they have not seen that data. University officials have asked for that data, but those requests have not been met."" As well as questioning UNC many times about the story before publication, CNN has also detailed Willingham's research. And purported e-mail exchanges obtained by CNN since August show that Willingham did share her findings at least twice -- once with Executive Vice Provost James W. Dean Jr., and once with a member of a university committee on academics and athletics. In addition, Willingham says her research on the students in the athletics programs that make money for the university was done based on screenings that the university itself paid for. And, she says, she has gotten permission from the university several times since 2008 to access those findings to continue her research. ""It's already available to them,"" Willingham said. ""It's in their system. ... They have all the data and more. It belongs to them, and they paid a lot of money for it."" Women who blew whistle and what happened next . Last year, when CNN asked UNC for comment on Willingham's research, officials initially denied knowing about it, and said: ""Such analysis is not part of her job duties at the university."" Then, after being shown the e-mails, a spokesperson admitted that Willingham did share her findings and did have permission from the university to do the research in the first place, and said a meeting with Willingham was being scheduled. Apart from Wednesday's statement, UNC has not responded to CNN's request for an explanation. In the meantime, Willingham said she has heard from one branch of the university -- the Department of Public Safety. Since CNN's report, Willingham said she's gotten four death threats, and more than 30 other alarming messages. ""Not people who disagree, people who put in the subject or body (of the e-mail) straight-up hate speech,"" she said. But there have also been notes of support from several other academic advisers around the country, Willingham says, and they make it worth the trouble. ""I've been getting more and more nice notes from high school teachers and literacy specialists across the country saying 'Thank you.'""

Probe: The BBC, ITV and Channel 4 fave an Ofcom investigation after interviewing Anjem Choudary after the Woolwich death of Drummer Lee Rigby . Broadcasting regulator Ofcom is investigating the BBC, ITV and Channel 4 over their decision to give airtime to Anjem Choudary after soldier Lee Rigby’s murder. Shocked viewers complained when the radical cleric refused to condemn the killing in Woolwich in interviews with Channel 4 News, BBC2’s Newsnight and ITV’s Daybreak following Fusilier  Rigby’s death on May 22. Choudary admitted he knew one of the suspects, Michael Adebolajo, after meeting him at Islamist demonstrations. Conservative peer Baroness Warsi said at the time that hate preachers who are ‘idiots and nutters’ should not be put on air. She added she was ‘really angry’ that broadcasters were ‘giving a platform to one appalling man who represents nobody’. After receiving 22 complaints from viewers, Ofcom has launched an official probe. The watchdog said there were grounds to look at whether the programmes met ‘acceptable standards’. Choudary appeared on Channel 4 News and Newsnight on May 23. He told Kirsty Wark on the BBC2 show he was ‘shocked’ by the murder but did not ‘abhor’ it. Home Secretary Theresa May said the Government had to look at ‘whether we’ve got the right processes, the right rules in place in relation to what is being beamed into people’s homes’. Tory MP Bob Stewart, a former colonel in the British army,  said the cleric should be banned but stopped short of calling  for a wider prohibition on extremists. He told BBC Radio 4’s World At One: ‘I think we should consider actually banning this individual but not necessarily others.’ Fusilier Rigby, 25, was buried last week at a service at Bury Parish Church in Greater Manchester attended by thousands.

"Washington (CNN) -- Although the war in Afghanistan remains unpopular with most Americans, the public supports President Obama's decision to send more U.S. troops to the conflict, according to a new national poll. Fifty-nine percent of those questioned in a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Wednesday morning said they favor the president's plan to send 30,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan, with 39 percent opposed. ""Most of those who oppose Obama's plan would like to see the U.S. immediately withdraw all its troops from Afghanistan,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. See complete poll results (PDF) The survey indicates that a majority of the public opposes the war, with 55 percent of respondents opposed and 43 percent in support of the U.S. mission in Afghanistan. ""Three in 10 say that they opposed the war from the start and another quarter report that they favored the war when it began in 2001 but oppose it now,"" Holland said. Only 18 percent of those polled said that the United States is winning in Afghanistan. Two-thirds said neither side is winning. ""That may explain the support for Obama's plan, since a victory is likely to require more troops,"" Holland said. ""But it may also explain the overall opposition to the war, since Americans tend to dislike losing."" The survey also indicates a racial divide over Afghanistan, with whites questioned split over the war, but seven in 10 black respondents opposed to the war. In a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll conducted last month and released November 24, 45 percent of those polled supported the war in Afghanistan, and 52 percent were opposed.

"By . Reuters Reporter . Federal securities regulators are probing whether New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's administration improperly diverted funds from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for use on transport projects in New Jersey. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into New Jersey's use of up to $1.8 billion in tax-exempt bond financing from the Port Authority to fix a bridge and roadways feeding into the New Jersey side of the Holland Tunnel, Main Justice reports. The SEC's inquiry follows several other probes launched after the so-called Bridgegate scandal, in which operatives loyal to Christie's administration are accused of causing traffic jams on the George Washington Bridge in September in retribution for a New Jersey mayor not endorsing Christie's re-election. Scroll down for video . Federal securities regulators are probing whether New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's administration improperly diverted funds from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for use on transport projects in New Jersey. Christie is pictured on Monday announcing the development of a megamall in East Rutherford . The controversy has prompted scrutiny of nearly every aspect of the Christie administration and his Port Authority appointees. The Manhattan District Attorney's office is looking into the use of Port Authority funds by New Jersey. Federal investigators and a New Jersey special legislative committee are also probing the bridge incident. About $3 billion of Port Authority funds were originally earmarked for an $8.7 billion project that would have built a new commuter train under the Hudson River. Though construction had already begun, Christie killed the project in 2010 after taking office.But New Jersey is using some of those funds to rebuild the Pulaski Skyway and roadways leading to the Holland Tunnel. The SEC's inquiry follows several other probes launched after the so-called Bridgegate scandal, in which operatives loyal to Christie's administration are accused of causing traffic jams on the George Washington Bridge in September in retribution for a New Jersey mayor not endorsing Christie's re-election . Under its 1921 charter, however, the bi-state Port Authority's purview includes access roads to the Lincoln Tunnel, but not to the Holland Tunnel. So the Christie administration allegedly pressured the Port Authority in 2011 to re-brand the Pulaski Skyway as feeding the Lincoln Tunnel. A Port Authority spokesman declined to comment to Reuters.

"By . Chris Pleasance . PUBLISHED: . 08:52 EST, 23 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 10:08 EST, 23 February 2014 . Samsung has unveiled its latest smartwatch which will double up as a TV remote and a fitness tracker as it tries to overcome the problems which plagued its first offering. The Gear 2, and sister device the Gear 2 Neo, will let users track their heart rate while exercising, offer fitness coaching and allow people to design their own workout routines. A built in LED will also let people control other electrical devices, such as their TV. The Samsung Gear 2 (right two watches) and Gear 2 Neo (left three watches) feature a camera built into the watch face, as well as a fitness tracker and LED which allows them to be used as a remote control . Design: The new Gear 2 (left) and Gear 2 Neo (right) come in a range of colours and feature a customisable clock face. The Neo has a slightly bigger display and is also lighter . Simon Stanford, vice president of Samsung UK & Ireland, said: 'Samsung continues to lead in the wearable technology market with innovative, creative devices that are completely integrated into the lives of our customers. 'Offering extended connectivity features, stylish customisation options and a robust application network, we have enhanced everything that people love about the original Samsung Gear to create a second generation of wearable devices that offer unparalleled smart freedom.' The new watch is the latest attempt by a technology firm to tempt buyers into the wearable tech market, which has yet to take off. Samsung's first smartwatch, the Galaxy Gear, proved unpopular with customers because of its poor battery life, clunky camera, and limited range of apps . Users were also critical of the fact that, without a constant connection to your phone, the Gear doesn't work . Sales of Samsung's first attempt, the Galaxy Gear, have been disappointing due in part to its poor battery life, clunky camera built into the strap and limited selection of apps. On the new Gear the camera has been moved on to the watch face, but it is unclear what customers will make of other improvements and additional features, such as a range of colours and customisable clock faces. Other companies, such as Pebble, have managed to garner more critical success with their offerings, but that hasn't translated into large sales figures. This latest fan mock-up of the iWatch appeared online as user speculate about the device. Apple has had issues developing the watch meaning the release date has been pushed back . Tech geeks have been creating mock-up ads as they await a release date. Apple reportedly had problems making some components and had to bring in outside help . Sony has just launched its new watch, the Smartwartch 2, which is less expensive and has longer battery life . Apple has reportedly run into number of problems developing its own 'iWatch', including difficulties making components, and has been forced to draft in outside help. The watch is said to have a 1.5inch screen and use Bluetooth to communicate with other devices, and may also feature Siri voice controls that let users dictate messages, rather than use the tiny screen. The watch could also be used as a remote control to change music tracks or pause video, on the phone or tablet. Part of the problem with wearable technology is the cost of shrinking the computer parts, with Google Glass costing $1,500 (£900) Sony has also just released its new smartwatch, and Google are due to start shipping their offering in March, though that date could be pushed back. Users have remained wary due to the high cost involved with shrinking the technology down, with Samsung's first Gear costing £300. Other wearable tech products have similar shortcomings, with Google Glass, high-tech glasses with a built-in computer, costing $1,500 (£900).","Samsung unveils new Gear 2 and Gear 2 Neo smartwatches .

"After months of intense political rumors, China's ruling Communist Party announced Tuesday an official probe into a retired senior leader for suspected ""serious disciplinary violation."" Zhou Yongkang, the former domestic security czar, was placed under investigation in accordance with Party regulations, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said in a one-line statement without elaborating. Before stepping down in late 2012, Zhou, 71, was one of the nine members that formed the Politburo Standing Committee, China's top decision-making body that effectively rules the country of more than 1.3 billion people. Under his watch, the domestic security budget swelled to surpass that of the military in the name of ""maintaining stability,"" as a widening income gap between the rich and the poor as well as growing discontent over official corruption fueled social unrest nationwide. Amid an intensifying anti-corruption campaign launched by President Xi Jinping, many political analysts and ordinary citizens have noted ties between an increasing number of disgraced officials and Zhou in recent months. Zhou himself had been rumored to be under house arrest before Tuesday's announcement. The Xi Jinping cipher: Reformer or a 'dictator'? State media have reported official anti-corruption probes into many of Zhou's family members as well as former associates in the domestic security apparatus, state oil industry and southwestern Sichuan province -- three places Zhou once ruled. Three of his former senior aides were arrested early this month. If indicted, Zhou would become the highest-ranking official ever to face corruption charges in the history of the People's Republic. ""It's almost certain the he would be put on trial and appear in public,"" said Professor Willy Lam with Chinese University of Hong Kong, a longtime commentator on Chinese politics. ""The important thing is that Xi Jinping has proven he's powerful enough to break this taboo of never incriminating former Politburo Standing Committee members -- and in the future he can use this anti-corruption card to thrash his political enemies."" The news on Zhou came on the heels of the downfall of several former high-ranking officials, including a retired top general of the 2 million-strong People's Liberation Army. Gen. Xu Caihou, a former vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, which runs the world's largest standing army, was expelled from the Communist Party and handed over to prosecutors after being found to have accepted bribes, state-run Xinhua news agency reported early this month. Xu was also a member of the Politburo before retiring in 2012. State media have characterized Xu as a big ""military tiger"" caught in the massive anti-graft campaign spearheaded by Xi, who is also the commander-in-chief. Xi banned official extravagance -- from banquets to year-end gifts -- and vowed to target ""tigers and flies"" alike in his fight against corruption. He resolved to spare no one, regardless of position. CCTV recently touted the capture of 35 ""tigers"" since Xi took power less than two years ago. Some 182,000 officials were disciplined in 2013, while courts nationwide tried 23,000 corruption cases, according to the Communist Party's disciplinary commission. State media have cited the trial and conviction last year of former high-flying politician Bo Xilai -- a protégé of Zhou -- as a prime example of Xi's determination to clean up the party, though Bo supporters called the case against him politically motivated. ""Now everybody is really scared -- and this would have a big impact on the behavior of senior Party members,"" said Lam, the political analyst. ""But nobody expects corruption to be eradicated. It is built into the system, a system without checks and balances.""","""It's almost certain"" Zhou would be put on trial, a longtime political observer says .

"By . Emma Innes . PUBLISHED: . 18:01 EST, 23 October 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 18:01 EST, 23 October 2013 . The average Briton spends almost a year of their working life off sick, new research has revealed . The average Briton spends almost a year of their working life off sick, new research has revealed. Workers take an average of 360 days sick leave during a standard 45 year career. The finding means we spend almost a year-and-a-half of our working lives off work as there are on average 252 days in a working year. But a third of full-time workers - 36 per cent - would only receive Statutory Sick Pay of £86.70 a week as they have no company sick policy. The National Sickness Report surveyed 2,000 full-time workers to look at their current health and gauge their attitudes towards sickness. Stress and depression are now the most common causes of long-term absence in the workplace and require an average recovery time of 81 days. That means workers who are absent with either illness and are without a company sick policy could end up thousands of pounds out of pocket. According to the Office for National Statistics, the average UK wage is £26,664. It means workers at the mercy of Statutory Sick Pay could lose on average £4,671 if they collected just £86.70 a week over 81 days. Mark Jones, from LV= who carried out the survey, said: ‘Often when we talk about workplace absence we look at the cost to businesses. ‘However, we wanted to highlight the impact that being off sick can have on an individual’s finances and lifestyle. ‘The fact that one in three would only receive Statutory Sick Pay indicates that many would be out of pocket and struggling financially. ‘It could be worse if they were off work for a long period of time and our findings show many people are.’ According to latest figures, 131 million working days are lost annually in Britain due to sickness - the equivalent of eight days per worker. But almost half - 44 per cent - of workers who have been off sick have returned to work early due to financial concerns. Stress and depression are now the most common causes of long-term absence in the workplace and require an average recovery time of 81 days . In fact, the research revealed Britons are quite unprepared for a bout of sickness as more than half - 52 per cent - didn’t know what they would be entitled to. Mr Jones said: ‘Whilst no one wants to think about getting ill, unfortunately none of us are invincible. ‘The reality is that some people will need to be off work for a large chunk of time. ‘When we buy a car, a washing machine or even a phone we resign ourselves to the fact that at some point it might breakdown. ‘However, far too few of us have a back-up plan in place that would protect our income if we found ourselves unable to work. ‘Having a contingency plan, such as income protection, offers peace of mind so if we become ill we can focus on recovering.’","Workers take an average of 360 days sick leave during a 45 year career .

"Russia has banned transsexual and transgender people from driving as they are deemed to have 'mental disorders' which make them more likely to crash. Also on the list of those prohibited from obtaining licences are exhibitionists, fetishists and voyeurs, with the government claiming it is tightening up controls to cut the number of accidents on the roads. The shocking announcement follows international outrage at Russia's position on homosexuality and its harassment of gay-rights activists prior to the Sochi Winter Olympics. Scroll down for video . New ban: Russia has banned transsexual and transgender people from driving as they are deemed to have 'mental disorders' which make them more likely to crash. (Above, a traffic jam in central Moscow) Russian psychiatrists and human rights lawyers have condemned the move - which also puts 'pathological' gamblers and compulsive thieves on the banned list. Speaking to the BBC Russian Service, Valery Evtushenko at the Russian Psychiatric Association, voiced concern about the  restrictions. He claimed that some people would avoid seeking psychiatric help for fear of losing their licence. And Mikhail Strakhov, a Russian psychiatric expert, said the definition of 'personality disorders' was far too vague - with many disorders listed not affecting a person's ability to safely drive a car. The Association of Russian Lawyers for Human Rights labelled the new law 'discriminatory'. It said it would demand further clarity from the Russian Constitutional Court while also seeking support from international human rights groups. Strict: Also on the list of those restricted from driving are 'pathological' gamblers and compulsive thieves . But the Professional Drivers Union supported the move, with the group's chief Alexander Kotov, saying: 'We have too many deaths on the road, and I believe toughening medical requirements for applicants is fully justified.' Russia's attitude to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) citizens recently garnered fierce international criticism in the run up to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The world speculated  as to how the country's controversial 'gay propaganda' law would affect foreign athletes participating in the games and fans in attendance. International criticism: Russia's stance on its LGBT residents came under intense scrutiny last year as a result of its controversial 'gay propaganda' law. Above, Russian President Vladimir Putin . Human Rights First condemned the driving ban and put a statement on their website which read: 'Banning people from driving based on their gender identity or expression is ridiculous and just another example of the Russian regime's methodical rollback of basic human rights for its citizens. 'Beyond the denial of basic freedoms, this provision may deter transgender people from seeking mental health services for fear of receiving a diagnosis that would strip them of their right to drive, and leaves the door open for increased harassment, persecution, and discrimination of transgender people by Russian authorities. 'We urge the United States to immediately condemn this provision and to press the Russian government to repeal this decision.' The resolution, which was developed by the Russian Ministry of Health, is the first of its kind to include these 'mental disorders.'","Government says it's tightening medical controls to cut road accidents .

"With the return of Sherlock Holmes from the dead and a dramatic festive episode from Coronation Street, last year’s television on New Year’s Day was always going to be hard to beat.

"One of Britain’s swankiest casinos has come up with a revolutionary way of getting round the smoking ban – by putting gaming tables on its new roof garden. The multi-million-pound development at the Hilton Hotel in Park Lane, Central London, will enable clients to enjoy a cigarette and gamble at the same time, and is expected to be particularly popular with wealthy clients who find the ban on smoking in enclosed public spaces irksome. The move will see a return to the days of Dr No, when Sean Connery as 007 meets the voluptuous Sylvia Trench at Le Cercle club, languidly puts a Morland cigarette to his lips and introduces himself with the immortal line: ‘Bond. James Bond.’ The name's Bond - James Bond: Sean Connery, as 007, lights up a cigarette in a casino in 1962's Dr No . Today, the suave spy would be liable for prosecution for breaking the smoking ban – the reason why a roof garden extension is being added to the hotel’s Park Lane Casino for its aptly named ‘high rollers’. David Mills, the hotel’s operations director, said: ‘Many of our clients come from countries where smoking bans do not apply. We want to provide them with a relaxing and enjoyable experience.’ Gaming tables will be placed on the terrace so that roulette, blackjack, baccarat and three-card poker can be played under the stars, although Westminster Council has banned live and recorded music in case it disturbs nearby residents. The multi-million-pound development at the Hilton Hotel in Park Lane (pictured), Central London, will enable clients to enjoy a cigarette and gamble at the same time . A gambling industry source said: ‘It’s no secret that casinos have been looking for ways to get round the smoking ban since it was introduced in 2007 and this is one of the solutions they have come up with.’ London is a favoured destination for international gamblers, many of whom are from the Middle East, and bets totalling millions of pounds are placed at casinos each night. Earlier this year, Mariam Aziz, the former wife of the world’s richest man, the Sultan of Brunei, described in court how she went on ‘reckless gambling sprees’ in Mayfair. Among the clubs visited were Les Ambassadeurs, Aspinalls and Rendezvous, and she confessed to blowing £500,000 in a single night. The Park Lane Casino opened at the Hilton last November, and membership costs £1,000 a year. The terrace on a new second-floor extension is due to open in April.","Outdoor casino earmarked for Hilton Hotel in Park Lane, Central London .

"PC Howard: The 35-year-old officer says she was 'put through hell' by the Met Police . A black woman firearms officer said she suffered ‘13 months of hell’ before a criminal inquiry into her conduct was dropped yesterday. PC Carol Howard, 35, claimed the inquiry only went on for so long because she had successfully challenged racism and sexism in the Metropolitan Police. The officer, who was the force’s Olympics security poster girl in 2012, learned she will face no further action over claims linked to a dispute with her ex-husband. Last night, she said: ‘I’m appalled and disgusted that the police put me through 13 months of hell simply because I stood up to the Met Police and challenged the discrimination at work. ‘As a working officer, I know these allegations would not normally have been investigated in this way and for this long. 'I was punished for challenging them and they tried to smear me. Lessons need to be learned by the police, and quickly.’ Sussex Police had investigated a string of incidents which allegedly took place in 2012-2013. But the Crown Prosecution Service found there was insufficient evidence to bring charges of perverting the course of  justice and harassment. A claim of common assault was not pursued as the alleged incident took place more than two years ago and there is a six-month limit on the offence. A further claim that PC Howard possessed an indecent image of a child was dropped as the photograph was of her daughter. This month, the elite officer was awarded £37,000 for suffering appalling treatment in the Met’s Diplomatic Protection Group. Judges found PC Howard was targeted for almost a year by a senior officer while working in the Met’s Diplomatic Protection Group. The decision to end the inquiry is unlikely to be the final chapter in an ongoing acrimonious dispute between PC Howard and the force. The officer, the force's poster girl for the 2012 Olympic Games, right, claims the inquiry into her arrests only went on for so long because she successfully challenged the force over racism and sexual discrimination . She has accused the force of trying to ‘smear’ her by releasing details of her arrest at the hands of The Met and neighbouring Sussex. Senior officers are still considering whether to bring a misconduct case against her, something which could yet end her police career. Earlier this week the Equality and Human Rights Commission announced it will investigate the force over its handling of internal complaints. The tribunal found officers routinely deleted references to discrimination from reports, including one relating to PC Howard. A Crown Prosecution Service spokesman said: ‘We have advised Sussex Police that no further criminal action should be taken.’","Carol Howard, 35, won race and sex discrimination case against Met in July .

"The final whistle would normally cue screams of celebration. But today's inaugural Miami Beach Brawl ended in a mass fight between the victorious Memphis Tigers and notoriously straight-laced BYU Cougars. Dozens of players on both sides were seen dealing physical blows, with some even wielding helmets as weapons. It has been an embarrassment for Brigham Young University's college team, which is grappling to wedge itself into the upper echelons of league football - while promoting the school's Mormon values. Scroll down for video... Brawl! The field was flooded with Memphis and BYU players in a bloody fight as the final whistle blew . Bloodied: BYU player Kai Nacua is facing expulsion after he was caught on camera punching an opponent . The Memphis Tigers had just scored their first win in nine years, defeating the BYU Cougars 55-48. But Christian Stewart, on the losing side, closed the game by throwing an interception. And havoc ensued. The Tigers' Chase Johnson was caught on camera swinging his helmet into the head BYU center Tejan Koroma - who was fighting off four other opponents. Meanwhile BYU defensive Kai Nacua could be seen punching the back of an opponent's head, and now faces expulsion. Around them, players on both teams' benches descended on the field and piled on top of each other. The coaches can be seen trying to restrain anyone they come into contact with - to no avail. Violent: Memphis Tigers' Chase Johnson could be seen coming up behind a group lifting his helmet . Shockingly, Johnson launches over his teammate's shoulder towards an opponent . Brutal: He is then captured on camera swinging the helmet into the opponent's head . Outrage: Twitter users fumed at the footage, which has sparked outrage across Memphis and Provo . Fight: Memphis Tigers and BYU Cougars players streamed onto the field at the end of the Miami Beach Bowl . Escalated: It was a violent conclusion to the tense and exhilarating game, which Memphis won 55-48 . It was a bloody conclusion to what had been an exhilarating and tense contest. Paxton Lynch, a Memphis quarterback, scored four touchdowns, went for another three and passed for more than 300 yards. BYU's Stewart threw for 349 yards and three touchdowns. Tom Holmoe, BYU athletics director, tweeted an apology: 'We expect better of our athletes, even in the face of a difficult loss. We intend to fully review this matter. I apologize to Cougar Nation.' The outburst prompted a slew of Twitter reaction and opinion columns in Salt Lake City, Utah, near where BYU is located. The Salt Lake Tribune's Gordon Monson wrote: 'It was sad. It was pathetic.' 'Totally disgusted with the BYU players complete lack of class,' one tweet read. Another user referenced the school's Honor Code, which - if violated - can warrant expulsion: 'BYU... Honor Code violation?' Restraint: BYU's Latanoa Pikula tries to block one player from another as the brawl escalates .

"President Barack Obama, in Hawaii for a weekend economic conference, said Saturday that leaders of nine nations have agreed on the ""broad outlines"" of a trans-Pacific free trade agreement. The United States has been negotiating with Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Brunei Darussalam, Singapore, Vietnam, Chile and Peru to develop the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which officials have said could eventually expand to include other nations. Speaking at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Honolulu, Obama pushed the expanded trade deal as a way to help boost investment and exports, create jobs, and ""compete and win in the markets of the future."" The president is on a nine-day trip through the Asia-Pacific region that will include stops in Australia and Indonesia. ""I'm very pleased to announce that our nine nations have reached the broad outlines of an agreement. There are still plenty of details to work out, but we are confident that we can do so. So we've directed our teams to finalize this agreement in the coming year. It is an ambitious goal, but we are optimistic that we can get it done,"" he said, according to remarks provided by his office. The next round of negotiations is scheduled for early next month. Obama said the TPP has the potential to be a model for future trade agreements elsewhere in the world, as it will address issues not covered in previous pacts. It will ensure that state-owned enterprises compete fairly with private companies and address trade and investment in digital technologies. Obama's administration is taking care to highlight the importance of strong Asia-Pacific relations to the president's efforts to create jobs domestically. ""The U.S. exports to this region are essential to the president's goal of doubling U.S. exports in the next several years,"" Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, told reporters in a briefing this week. ""In fact, nearly all of the efforts that we're going to be making towards that export goal take place in this part of the world."" The 21 members of APEC account for 55% of the world's gross domestic product, 43% of world trade and 58% of U.S. exports, according to the group. ""So I think when the American people see the president traveling in the Asia-Pacific, they will see him advocating for U.S. jobs and U.S. businesses,"" Rhodes said. ""He will be trying to open new markets, and he will be trying to achieve new export initiatives, and he will be trying to foster a trade agreement through the, for instance, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, that takes us beyond the Korea Free Trade Agreement towards a multilateral agreement that, again, has very high standards to ensure that our interests are being protected."" During the weekend conference, Obama was also scheduled to have a discussion with business leaders, as well as side meetings with Russian President Dimitry Medvedev and Chinese President Hu Jintao. Obama met with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda on Saturday. After a break Monday for a political fundraiser, Obama is scheduled to depart Tuesday for Australia and later Bali, Indonesia, where he will stress the U.S. role in the Asia-Pacific region and seek to reassure U.S. allies of the nation's continued commitment to the region, Rhodes said. Speaking to business leaders on Saturday, the president addressed the need to campaign aggressively on behalf of the United States to boost business. ""We've been a little bit lazy, I think, over the last couple of decades. We've kind of taken for granted -- well, people will want to come here and we aren't out there hungry, selling America and trying to attract new business into America,"" he said. ""We can do much better than we're doing right now.""","Leaders agree on the outline of a trans-Pacific trade agreement .

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- China has threatened to slap sanctions on American companies that sell arms to its rival Taiwan as part of a range of punitive actions Beijing is taking to protest the deal. China also summoned U.S. ambassador Jon Huntsman to express its anger over Washington's announcement, the official Chinese news agency Xinhua said, citing the Foreign Ministry. Beijing also suspended plans for visits between the Chinese and U.S. militaries and postponed a high-level arms control meeting, it announced Saturday, following Washington's $6.4-billion arms deal with Taiwan. China's Defense Ministry said the decision was made ""in consideration of the serious harm and impacts on Sino-U.S. military relations"" brought about by the arms deal, according to Xinhua. ""China will make further judgments as appropriate,"" Xinhua reported. China had already complained to the United States about the deal, announced Friday by the Obama administration. Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei called it a ""rude interference in China's internal affairs, severely endangering China's national security"" and said China expressed its ""strong indignation."" The arms sale includes 60 Black Hawk helicopters, totaling $3.1 billion; 114 advanced Patriot air defense missiles; a pair of Osprey mine-hunting ships; and dozens of advanced communications systems. The deal with Taiwan -- which neither China nor the United States recognizes as an independent country -- does not include F-16 fighter jets, which China has vehemently opposed. The State Department described the latest round of arms sales to Taiwan as a way to guarantee security and stability, despite China's objections. ""This is a clear demonstration of the commitment this administration has to provide Taiwan with defensive weapons it needs and as provided for in the Taiwan Relations Act,"" State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Friday. He said the action is consistent with Washington's ""one-China"" policy and will help maintain security and stability across the Taiwan Strait. The arms sales come as the United States is hoping to persuade China to sign on to harsher sanctions against Iran and just after Secretary of State Hillary Clinton criticized China for its policies relating to the Internet. Crowley would not speak directly about the timing of the announcement of the sales, and about the fact that the arms package does not include F-16s. A senior U.S. official said later that the United States expected Chinese criticism of the arms deal, but does not expect permanent damage. The official said he believed Clinton had discussed the sale in London with her Chinese counterpart on the sidelines of Thursday's international conference on Afghanistan. ""This relationship between the United States and China is broad, it's deep. There are a large number of issues. We don't see eye to eye with them and we have to have and do have the ability to speak honestly,"" the official said. The arms deal is the latest chapter in a decades-long uneasy standoff. China claims Taiwan is its own territory and has threatened to invade if Taiwan ever declares independence. The United States has said it will defend Taiwan if China ever attacks. The government in Taiwan began as the remnant of the government that ruled over mainland China until a Communist insurrection proved victorious in 1949. With the Communist takeover of mainland China, the losing faction fled to the island of Taiwan. Taiwan is formally known as the Republic of China, while Communist China's official name is People's Republic of China. Many Western nations and the United Nations recognized Taiwan as the legitimate Chinese government until the 1970s.

"The  jihadi gunman who killed a police woman and four hostages at a kosher deli in Paris was buried near the French capital today after his own country of birth  refused him. Mali had rejected the body of terrorist Amedy Coulibaly on Wednesday- the day before he was expected to be buried in its soil in Bamako. Now police sources say the Islamist- who killed a policewoman and four Jewish hostage during the January 7-9 attacks on Paris-  has been buried in the Muslim section of the Thiais cemetery in the Paris region. Scroll down for video . Nowhere to go: The body of French jihadi Amedy Coulibaly has been rejected by his birth country, Mali. Coulibaly killed four customers of a kosher supermarket as well as a policewoman . The 32-year-old small-time dope dealer-cum-terrorist was gunned down by police as they raided the Hyper Cacher kosher supermarket in east Paris on January 9, the day police tracked down Charlie Hebdo massacre gunmen Chérif and Saïd Kouachi. A day earlier he had shot dead a policewoman in the street and critically injured a street sweeper. His family had asked for him to be buried in Mali, but that country's government made a sudden U-turn the day before his burial. The West African country gave no reason for rejecting the killer's body which had remained in a fridge in the Forensic Institute in Paris until he was interred in Thiais today. Government spokesman Stephane Le Foll had confirmed he would be buried in France if his country of birth refused to accept his body. The Kouachi brothers, who were Frenchmen of Algerian heritage, were both buried in secret locations in their hometowns - Saïd in Rheims and Chérif in Gennevilliers, a suburb north of Paris - last weekend. Both were interred at night in unmarked graves, as authorities feared their resting places could become places of pilgrimage for extremists. The brothers were killed in a shoot-out after hiding in an industrial unit, two days after the attack on the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, in which they killed 12 people. Charlie Hebdo killers: The Kouachi brothers, who were Frenchmen of Algerian heritage, were both buried in secret locations in their hometowns - Saïd in Rheims and Chérif in Gennevilliers, a suburb north of Paris . Neither brothers' hometown wanted the terrorists, but were forced to find graves for them by a French law that grants a right to be buried in the district where the deceased lived or the district where they were killed. French media reports that no request for a grave has been made in Grigny, the impoverished south Paris suburb where Coulibaly grew up and where his mother and sister still live, nor in Viry-Chatillon, where he was registered to vote. So it seems most likely Coulibaly will be buried in Fontenay-aux-Roses, the Paris suburb where he had rented a safe house. A spokesman for the town's mayor said: 'If his family decide to bury him here, I don't think we'll be able to avoid it. The law is strict. But we hope he will be buried somewhere else.'","Sources say Amedy Coulibaly was buried in the Thiais cemetery in Paris .

"Women in Britain's armed forces could be allowed to fight in front line combat roles for the first time by 2016, the Ministry of Defence said Friday, as it published a review into how this would impact troops on the ground. According to the ministry, the review ""has ended the long-held view that mixed close ground combat units would have an adverse effect on cohesion between troops."" But it calls for more research into the physiological demands placed on those in close combat roles before a final decision is made on allowing women in. Ground close combat units are defined as those where ""the primary role is to close with and kill the enemy."" The potential impact on women's health of serving in such units should be fully examined, the review said. Researchers will also look at how training for such combat roles can be set up to ensure women are able to take part safely, without reducing combat effectiveness. ""Roles in our Armed Forces should be determined by ability not gender. I hope that, following further work on our training regimes and equipment, we can open up combat roles to women in 2016,"" said Defence Secretary Michael Fallon. At present, 70% of roles are open to women in the army, 79% in the navy, and 94% in the air force. Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Nicholas Carter, said UK military operations in Afghanistan had shown that there could be ""significant physiological risk to women"" serving in ground close combat roles. ""I look forward to the prospect of opening ground close combat roles to women, but we have to look at this in a responsible way,"" said Chief of the Defence Staff, General Sir Nicholas Houghton. ""Our aim must be to maximise the use of talent without compromising our standards or undermining capability. The final piece of work on physiological risks is vitally important in ensuring that ground close combat roles would not be detrimental to the health of our service women."" Women currently make up 10% of the UK armed forces, according to Ministry of Defence statistics from October, with 15,740 women in total employed across all services. Their numbers have gradually increased over the past two years in the army and remain stable in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. The Royal Navy allowed women to serve on board submarines for the first time this year, more than 20 years after women were first allowed to serve on surface ships. In another sign of increasing gender equality, two women have also reached the rank of rank of air vice-marshal in the Royal Air Force. The Pentagon took steps early last year to open up combat roles to the roughly 200,000 women in the U.S. armed forces. Announcing the move, then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said it was a bow to reality on the battlefield, where women in what are technically non-combat units already find themselves fighting alongside their male comrades.

"MADRID, Spain (CNN) -- A powerful car bomb exploded outside a regional television station in Spain's Basque region Wednesday after police got a warning call from the separatist group ETA, authorities said. Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero says ETA is losing all the battles. The blast occurred in the city of Bilbao around 11 a.m. (5 a.m. ET). The warning came an hour ahead of the bombing and gave police enough time to evacuate the area, including some 500 people working at the government-run Basque regional TV, known by its initials EiTB, and in other nearby offices. There were no immediate reports of casualties, but the blast shattered the glass facade of the TV station's new headquarters. It was the first major attack blamed on ETA since police arrested two of its suspected top leaders recently. ETA is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its long fight for Basque independence and is listed as a terrorist group by the European Union and the United States. Last month during an anti-terrorism raid in France, authorities captured the man then considered to be the overall chief of the Basque separatist group. Authorities said the suspect, Mikel Garikoitz Aspiazu, 35, alias ""Txeroki,"" was in charge of both ETA's military and political, or policymaking, wings. Just three weeks later, on December 8, police arrested Txeroki's alleged replacement, Aitzol Iriondo Yarza, 30, the new suspected head of the ETA commandos. He was also arrested in France, ETA's traditional rear guard base just across the border from Spain.  Watch the explosion » . After that, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said ETA was more ""isolated"" than ever and he ruled out fresh talks with them. ""The end of ETA can be seen only with the push from the rule of law,"" Zapatero said in an interview on December 18 with CNN affiliate Cuatro TV. He said police had arrested 365 ETA suspects in the past two years, notably the two recent suspected top ETA leaders and their alleged ETA chief predecessor, who was detained last May, also in France. On Wednesday after the Bilbao blast, Zapatero told an audience in southern Spain that ""ETA can attack but it is going to lose all the battles."" Top Spanish officials have repeatedly warned that ETA is not yet finished. An ETA communique during the autumn threatened many targets, including government-run media outlets. The previous major car bomb blamed on ETA was on October 30 at the University of Navarra in Pamplona, which injured 27 people and caused extensive damage. The Bilbao bomb comes two years after ETA's car bomb at Madrid's airport that killed two men and destroyed a parking garage. There are about 600 ETA convicts or suspects in Spanish jails and 150 others in French jails, authorities in the two countries have told CNN.","Bomb explodes outside a television station in Spain's Basque region .

"(CNN)  -- Houston Astros shortstop Miguel Tejada is expected to plead guilty Wednesday in federal court to a count of lying to Congress about his knowledge of Major League Baseball players using performance-enhancing drugs, according to officials familiar with the case. Miguel Tejada, a shortstop for the Houston Astros, has been charged with lying to Congress. In a document filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Tejada is charged in a criminal ""information,"" a document that routinely signals a plea bargain agreement. The document does not directly accuse Tejada of using steroids or other substances. However, the court document says that in 2003 Tejada gave another player more than $5,000 in checks ""for substances which he believed to be HGH [human growth hormone]."" The document says Tejada lied to congressional investigators when he told them on August 26, 2005, that he had never heard discussions about steroids by other players, and that he never knew of any other player using steroids. After the December 2007 Mitchell Report on steroid use in baseball, which appeared to contradict Tejada, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform asked the Justice Department to investigate whether Tejada ""made knowingly false statements to the committee."" The investigators concluded he had lied. ""Defendant Tejada unlawfully withheld pertinent information from the committee because defendant Tejada before and during his interview with the committee staff, then and there well knew that Player #1 [unidentified], one of his teammates on the Oakland Athletics, had used steroids and HGH,"" the document says. Tejada played for the Athletics from 1997 to 2003. He is scheduled to appear at 11 a.m. Wednesday before a magistrate judge, indicating the charge against him will be a misdemeanor carrying a maximum sentence of a year in jail. However, a government official familiar with the case said that under sentencing guidelines, Tejada could get from zero to 6 months, which means he may receive probation without jail time. Tejada, who started his MLB career in 1997, hit at least 30 home runs from 2000 through 2004 with the exception of 2003, when he hit 27. He won the American League's most valuable player award in 2002, when he hit a career-best 34 home runs. He matched that total in 2004, his first year with the Baltimore Orioles. He began playing with Houston in 2008. The information came one day after MLB star Alex Rodriguez -- the New York Yankees' third baseman since 2004 -- admitted that he had used a ""banned substance"" during the 2001-2003 seasons. Sports Illustrated had reported that Rodriguez had tested positive for steroids in 2003, when he was playing for the Texas Rangers.","Court document: Tejada knew teammate used performance-enhancing drugs .

Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning says he has no plans to quit the NFL even if he wins his second Super Bowl on Sunday. Manning, 37, has so far thrown a record breaking season of 55 touchdown passes and 5,447 yards, and will make history as the only quarterback to win Super Bowl titles with separate teams if the Denver Broncos beat the Seattle Seahawks. But the quarterback has denied speculation that he might quit while he's ahead, telling a press conference that he still enjoys the game and has no plans for a swift exit. Scroll down for video . Peyton Manning, 37, has said he has no plans to retire, even if the Denver Broncos win on Sunday . Speaking to Associated Press, he said: 'I think when you still enjoy the preparation and the work part of it, then you probably still ought to be doing that. 'I think as soon as I stop enjoying it, if I can't produce, if I can't help a team, that's when I'll stop. 'If that's next year, maybe it is, but I certainly want to continue to keep playing.' Manning previously won the Super Bowl in 2006 with the Indianapolis Colts, but following 14 season with the team he underwent surgery on a herniated disc in his spine, an injury which nearly cost him his career. If the Broncos are victorious, Manning will make history as the first quarterback to win the title with two separate teams. He won with the Indianapolis Colts in 2006 . The disc had been pressing on a nerve, and after the surgery he discovered his right tricep was very weak, and he was unable to grip properly with his right hand. The disc herniated again, and Manning went in for a second operation, before being dropped by the Colts and having to build his career up again. Now, with two vertebrae fused together, he is stronger than ever, and luckily for the Broncos Manning also hinted that he may be staying put. Manning has thrown a record-breaking season so far, with 5 touchdown passes and 5,447 yards . He added: 'In two years I feel like we've seen a lot, as far as on the field situations, weather, crowd noise, you name it, so I do feel comfortable.' Super Bowl XLVIII will take place on Sunday at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, in front of 82,500 fans.

"(CNN) -- Disneyland employees are paid to serve up magic and memories -- but not like this.

The blast did not hurt anyone, but it did rattle nerves and prompt the evacuation of that part of the park for a few hours. Anaheim police on Wednesday identified the suspect in the explosion as Christian Barnes, a Long Beach resident and an outdoor vendor at Disneyland. Booked on suspicion of possessing a destructive device, Barnes is being held on $1 million bail. ""Barnes is cooperating with investigators and has indicated this is an isolated incident with unanticipated impacts,"" police said in a press release. It all stems from an incident around 5:30 p.m. (8:30 p.m. ET) Tuesday, when people heard ""a small bang"" coming from a trash can in Toontown. ""Just a big boom and the trash can exploding ... the lid coming up ... people were at a standstill,"" Vanessa Vasquez told CNN affiliate KCBS.

"James DeGale will fight for the IBF super middleweight title on April 25 at London's O2 Arena following confirmation that Carl Froch is relinquishing that belt. The announcement came from promoter Eddie Hearn by way of a 29th birthday present for DeGale. But the mood of celebration was soured by DeGale's adviser, Ambrose Mendy, repeating the slur that 'Froch is a coward for not defending the title against James in the ring'. James DeGale (left) will fight for the IBF super middleweight title on April 25 at London's O2 Arena . DeGale (right) will fight for the IBF super middleweight title following Carl Froch's relinquishing of that belt . DeGale lost a contentious decision to George Groves (right) in 2011 in their grudge match . Hearn and DeGale's trainer, Jim McDonnell, refused to association themselves with that remark. Froch, meanwhile, is negotiating for two major defences of his WBA world title against Bernard Hopkins at the City Ground and Julio Cesar Chavez Jr in Las Vegas. Hearn confirmed also that George Groves is declining the possible opportunity of being the opponent for DeGale in the fight for the vacant IBF title. Groves, who narrowly defeated DeGale in their first grudge match, was second in line behind No 2 contender, Andre Dirrell. Negotiations with Dirrell to meet DeGale have already commenced, although the American is wary of returning to England after believing he was robbed of a decision against Froch in Nottingham. Hearn says: 'We will get a decision on Dirrell quickly by pressing for purse bids if he wants this agreement. Froch has vacated his IBF world title having not fought since beating George Groves last May . Froch had been due to face Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr in March but had to withdraw with an injury . 'If Dirrell refuses the fight then we will move down the list of contenders, starting with No 3, Gilberto Ramirez. But whatever happens, James will fight for the title on April 25 and I believe will become world champion that night.' DeGale is bidding to become the first British boxer to go on from winning Olympic gold and then winning a world title. He says: 'I don't care who is in the opposite corner. 'I wouldn't even care if it was Andre Ward, who everyone seems to think is the best super middleweight in the world. I'm just excited. I can't wait. 'It would be nice if it's Dirrell because I believe that us two and Ward are the three top super middleweights. Of course I would like it to be in London but if his team come up with more money then it wouldn't bother me to fight him in America.' It has taken more than six years for DeGale to be given this chance since winning gold in Beijing, and Hearn says: 'He's waited very patiently. 'He's boxed beautifully in his latest fights and he deserves his shot.'","James DeGale will fight on April 25 at London's O2 Arena .

"(CNN) -- Talk radio host Dr. Laura Schlessinger has issued an apology for saying the N-word several times during an on-air conversation with a caller this week. ""I talk every day about doing the right thing. And yesterday, I did the wrong thing,"" Schlessinger said on her radio show Wednesday.

"(CNN)  -- Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Thursday that Canada's governor general has allowed him to suspend Parliament, postponing a no-confidence vote from his opponents that he was likely to lose. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper says Parliament will resume on January 26. Harper called on his opponents to work with his government on measures to aid the nation's economy when Parliament returns on January 26. ""The first order of business will be the presentation of a federal budget,"" Harper told reporters outside the governor general's residence in Ottawa, Canada. ""Those who were elected here to serve the interest of Canada as a whole should work together -- at least to some degree -- on planning an economic plan for Canada."" Had Governor General Michaelle Jean -- who represents Britain's Queen Elizabeth II as head of state -- denied Harper's request, Monday's vote would have likely brought down Harper's government, less than two months after his Conservative Party strengthened its minority position in federal elections. The Liberal Party and the leftist New Democratic Party announced plans earlier this week to form a governing coalition with the support of the Bloc Quebecois, which supports independence for French-speaking Quebec. Liberal Party Leader Stephane Dion, the man who would fill Harper's role under the planned coalition, said the coalition would look to replace Harper unless he makes ""monumental change."" ""For the first time in the history of Canada, the prime minister of Canada is running away from the parliament of Canada,"" said Dion, accusing the premier of placing ""partisan politics ahead of the interest of all Canadians."" New Democratic Party leader Jack Layton said Harper had used a ""maneuver to escape accountability."" ""He refuses to face the people of Canada through their elected representatives,"" he said. ""The prime minister is choosing to protect his own job rather than focusing on the jobs of Canadians who are being thrown out of work today."" The news comes one day after Harper appealed directly to Canadians for support, vowing in a nationally televised address on the economy to halt his opponents, whom he accused of imposing their own agenda on the Canadian people. ""Unfortunately, even before the government has brought forward its budget, and only seven weeks after a general election, the opposition wants to overturn the results of that election,"" said the prime minister, whose Conservative Party strengthened its minority position in federal elections on October 14. iReport.com: Outrage brewing in Canada . Harper rejected the idea of a ""power-sharing coalition with a separatist party,"" referring to the Bloc Quebecois, and insisted the country must stand together. ""At a time of global economic instability, Canada's government must stand unequivocally for keeping the country together. At a time like this, a coalition with the separatists cannot help Canada,"" he said Wednesday. ""The opposition is attempting to impose this deal without your say, without your consent, and without your vote. This is no time for backroom deals with the separatists; it is the time for Canada's government to focus on the economy and specifically on measures for the upcoming budget. This is a pivotal moment in our history,"" he said. Harper, 49, has served as prime minister since February 2006.","NEW: Opposition accuses PM Harper of putting his job ahead of Canada's interests .

"(CNN) -- Li Na set up a French Open semifinal clash with former world number one Maria Sharapova after toppling fourth seed Victoria Azarenka at Roland Garros. It is the first time that Li, from China, has made the final four in Paris and she did it in style by knocking out the highest remaining seed 7-5 6-2 on Court Philippe Chatrier. Sharapova looked in fine form after a ruthless display against Andrea Petkovic, beating her German opponent 6-0 6-3, and is now in sight of completing a career Grand Slam, having won the other three major tournaments on the tennis calendar. The winner of their clash will face either defending champion Francesca Schiavone, from Italy, or France's 11th seed Marion Bartoli in the final. Li was beaten in the final of the Australian Open by Kim Clijsters back in January, when she became the first Chinese player to make a major final. And she is now one win away from another after a battling display against her opponent from Belarus that saw her hit back from a break down in each set. In the opener, Li dropped the third game on her serve but hit back immediately, before taking a 4-3 lead after a marathon seventh game. She held out to clinch the first 7-5. Again Li found herself a break down early in the second set but made her speed around the court count to peg Azarenka back instantly and surge to the finishing line. ""After I won the match I was feeling, 'Wow, I can play semi in Roland Garros'. I never think about that before,"" Li told AFP. ""So many people think I'm not so good on a clay court, but I think now they should change a little bit."" Sharapova took just 91 minutes to seal her victory, breaking Petkovic in the first, third and fifth games to complete a whitewash in the opening set. Despite being held at 3-3 in the second, Sharapova then stormed ahead to clinch the match. ""It was tougher than the scoreline suggests. There were a lot of games that could have gone either way. I played really smart on the important points,"" Sharapova was quoted as saying by AFP. ""There is no doubt I have improved on this surface. As the years have gone on I feel I have got better and better.

"(CNN) -- Think you use your phone to look at Facebook a lot? Unless you're doing it at least 14 times a day, you're actually below average. That's just one of the surprising revelations in a research report by IDC released Wednesday. The study tapped 7,446 iPhone and Android users in the U.S. between 18 and 44 — representative of the 50% of the population that uses smartphones — and asked them questions about their phone usage across one week in March. Depending on your perspective, many of the results are either depressing or confirm what you knew all along. For example, it seems that 79% of smartphone users reach for their devices within 15 minutes of waking up. A clear majority — 62% — don't even wait 15 minutes, and grab their phones immediately. (Among 18- to 24-year-olds, the numbers rise to 89% and 74%.) Given that the survey was sponsored by Facebook, most of the questions focus on the social network. Which is, it seems, only the third most popular app on your smartphone, after email and the browser. Still, 70% of smartphone users are frequent Facebook visitors, with more than half of them checking it every day. Peak Facebook time is during the evening, just before bed. But any time's good: on average, we visit the Facebook app or the site 13.8 times during the day, for two minutes and 22 seconds each time. Our average total daily mobile time on the site — and remember, this is just via our smartphones — is half an hour. That's roughly a fifth of all the time we spend communicating; it's only slightly less time than we spend texting. On weekends, we check Facebook more than we text. Any place seems to be good to check Facebook, too. Some 46% of us check it when we're shopping or running errands; 48% use it at the gym. Even preparing a meal gives 47% of us no respite from the social network. (Well, what else are you going to do while you're waiting for the microwave to ping?) Perhaps the most unpardonable sin: 50% of smartphone users admit to checking Facebook while at a movie. We hope they mean only during the ads. So what are we spending all that time doing? Well, for about half of that daily half-hour on the social network, we're simply browsing our News Feed. The rest of the time is divided fairly evenly between Facebook messaging and posting updates. Half of Facebook users play games via the service on their phone a few times a day. Does the smartphone survey ring true to you? Share your thoughts in the comments. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

"By . Jennifer Smith . PUBLISHED: . 10:45 EST, 21 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:57 EST, 21 November 2013 . Judge Paul Batty QC deferred Musgrave's sentencing for six months so he may spend Christmas with his 14-year-old daughter for the first time . A drug dealer who has spent the last 14 Christmases in prison has been spared jail by a sympathetic judge so he may spend the festive season with his daughter. Richard Musgrave, 35, begged Judge Paul Batty not to send him to prison after spending every Christmas in his teenage daughter's life behind bars for a string of drug-related crimes. The father from Carlisle, Cumbria, was told to 'stay out of trouble' for the next six months in return for a non-custodial sentence after admitting one count of methadone, a Class A drug. Carlisle Crown Court heard how Musgrave, who appeared alongside two others, also pleaded guilty to two counts of theft before being told he could spend the festive season at home. Judge Batty said: 'I am going to give you the best Christmas present you could ever hope for now - your liberty, but it will be in measured terms. 'If you stay out of trouble for the next six months you can expect a non-custodial sentence - because I always keep my promises. If you offend, to custody you will go.' Prosecuting David Potter described how Musgrave used an old key to let himself into the home of his former long-term partner where he stole £40 from her purse in June. He later stole a pack of bacon from a Spar shop, the court was told. In his defence, barrister Tim Evans described the man as 'a hopeless, long-term drug addict' who 'has tried to do something about his addiction.' In light of his efforts to overcome his long history of drug abuse, the judge deferred sentencing for six months. Musgrave’s co-defendants John Thompson, 34, and Kirsty Davidson, 25, admitted being concerned in the supply of heroin and methadone, while Davidson also pleaded guilty to the supply of methamphetamine. Mr Potter described how police raided the Cumbria home shared by Davidson and Thompson and found various drugs - including cocaine hidden in a Kinder egg - and drug paraphernalia. Traces of heroin and methadone were found in plastic sandwich bags, while as much as £93 worth of methadone was found in two bottles in the house. Musgrave appeared at Carlisle Crown Court alongside two other defendants who were imprisoned for offences relating to drug dealing . Thompson and Davidson admitted being addicted to drugs, yet initially denied supplying them to others. However the former's defence told the court the pair dealt the illegal substances to fund their own habits. Brendan Burke, for Davidson, said his client played a lesser role in the drug supply offence, and that she had returned to drug abuse after the death of her father. Judge Batty jailed Thompson for 32 months, while Davidson received a sentence of two years.","Richard Musgrave spared jail to spend first Christmas with his daughter .

"A sailor and his boyfriend have become the first ever male same-sex couple to share the ceremonial first kiss as they marked the homecoming of submarine warship USS San Francisco. Thomas Sawicki arrived at Naval Base Point Loma in San Diego, California on Monday to find his boyfriend Shawn Brier waiting to greet him as he returned to his home port. The men, who had been chosen to share the first kiss, were photographed in their embrace. 'Everyone was cheering for me when they announced it over email,' Sawicki told NBC San Diego. 'Everyone was very excited, very supportive, very happy.' Scroll down for video . Reunited: Shawn Brier, right, greeted his boyfriend Thomas Sawicki as he arrived at Naval Base Point Loma in San Diego, California on Monday. He had been away on USS San Francisco for seven months . Back together: The couple said that their family and friends had been so excited when they were chosen . The seven month stint in the Western Pacific had been Sawicki's first deployment, and when he returned, Brier didn't want eyes to be on them for the wrong reasons. 'I don't want to screw it up and fall in the water or something,' Brier told NBC before the kiss. But he managed to stay on the dock and excitedly welcomed his partner back to the shore, as other families lined the port to welcome back their husbands, sons, fathers and brothers. The USS San Francisco is the second oldest warship submarine in its fleet and in a few years it will be re-purposed as a training platform for newly recruited nuclear officers, NBC reported. In 2005, the warship smashed into an underwater fountain, killing a sailor and injuring 97 sailors - and costing $134 million to repair it. The male same-sex kiss on Monday comes more than three years after the Navy marked a homecoming with a female same-sex kiss. Video: CBS 8 San Diego .

"Troubled footballer Clarke Carlisle has revealed he has split from his wife as he continues to battle with depression following his failed suicide attempt. The former Premier League defender said he had 'moved out of the marital home' in Yorkshire that he shared with his wife of 14 years, Gemma. Mr Carlisle tried to kill himself in December, two days after he was arrested on suspicion of drink-driving. Scroll down for video . Split: Clarke Carlisle says he has 'moved out of the marital home' in Yorkshire that he shared with his wife of 14 years, Gemma. The pair are pictured together in 2013 . The 35-year-old father-of-three stepped in front of a 12-ton truck on the A64 near York in December, suffering cuts, bruises, internal bleeding, a broken rib and a shattered left knee. The incident has left the ex-Burnley defender with scars all over his body. On television this week Mr Carlisle, who has publicly struggled with depression, revealed the scars he still bears from his suicide attempt are a 'constant reminder' of his good fortune in surviving. Now Mr Carlisle, who played 131 times for the Clarets between 2007 and 2012, said the accident had led to him moving out of the house he shared with wife Gemma. The sportsman, dubbed 'Britain's brainiest footballer' after he appeared on Countdown in 2002, told TalkSport Radio on a special Monday night show: 'At this point, Gemma and I have separated. 'I have moved out of the marital home because I have to focus on my well-being and equally as much Gemma has to do the same. 'She has to deal with her experiences and the effect that has had on her.' Mr Carlisle appeared on Good Morning Britain this week and revealed the scars he still bears from his suicide attempt are a 'constant reminder' of his good fortune in surviving . Asked about how his wife Gemma has taken it, he added: 'Every day has been incredibly tough and different. 'When you have been with someone for 14 years but masking things and thoughts from her, it was because I was a people-pleaser. 'I've desperately wanted to say what I know will make her happy and do the things that I think she wants me to do - instead of being myself.' Earlier this week Mr Carlisle apologised to the driver of the lorry which he jumped in front of in an attempt to kill himself. The former footballer said that he prays for the driver, Darren Pease, every day - but added that he has been unable to apologise in person because the haulier refuses to meet him. Star: Mr Carlisle pictured playing for Burnley against Aston Villa in 2010, at the peak of his footballing career . Appearing on ITV's Good Morning Britain on Tuesday, Mr Carlisle said he was 'so sorry' for putting Mr Pease through the ordeal of being involved in a near-fatal crash. Speaking earlier this month, Mr Pease, 53, said that he might never be able to drive a lorry again after hitting Mr Carlisle. Mr Carlisle played for nine different clubs in his 16-year career, including five years at Burnley, and served as chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association. Last week, he pleaded guilty to failing to provide a sample when he was stopped by police in December as his car was swerving around the road. He will be sentenced in May.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . A dirty bomb attack is a ‘real threat’ faced by Britain, the Foreign Office warned today. The government claims nuclear terrorism is still one of the biggest threats to global peace. Foreign Office minister Alistair Burt used a speech in London to warn of the dangers posed by a rise nuclear weapons being smuggled around the world. Alistair Burt will say countries around the world face a 'real and global threat' of a nuclear terror attack. South Korean radiologists are pictured taking part in an exercise in dealing with a possible radioactive terror attack at the Kimpo airport . He warned  that information freely available on the internet combined with nuclear material become more widely available means an attack, once ‘unthinkable’ is not a ‘real and global threat’. Mr Burt, who has responsibility for our counter-terrorism policy, said the UK’s National Security Strategy identified nuclear terrorism as a primary danger to Britain. He said: ‘Nuclear terrorism is a real and global threat.  A successful attack, no matter where in the world it came, would be catastrophic. ‘Catastrophic for the immediate devastation and terrible loss of life, and for the far-reaching consequences – psychological, economic, political, and environmental. ‘Such an attack was unthinkable just a generation ago.  But it is now a possibility we need to confront with the utmost vigilance.’ Mr Burt said nuclear material is becoming ‘more available’ as more countries develop nuclear energy. Mr Burt warns there is more information about nuclear weapons on the internet than ever before . ‘In today’s world of modern . communication, information is spreading faster.  Like nuclear energy, . this brings huge benefits, but it also brings significant risks.  There . is more information about nuclear weapons on the internet than there . ever has been. ‘As is the case in cyberspace, the . danger is stateless in geographical space.  It is impossible for any . national government or police force, no matter how advanced, to contain . on its own. ‘Global smuggling networks are thriving.  Criminal cells operate across borders and across continents.’ He said the UK has been at the ‘forefront’ of tackling illicit trafficking of nuclear material. ‘It was an issue very much at the forefront of our security preparations . for our hosting of a successful London Olympics this summer.’ He also lifted the lid on the UK’s . secretive Atomic Weapons Establishment which works on detecting the . trade in nuclear material.  ‘This is a rare opportunity to publically . acknowledge that their work has been central to the defence of the . United Kingdom for over 50 years,’ he said. Mr Burt’s stark warning came as he addressed a meeting in London of experts from around the world discussing ways to prevent a devastating attack. His warning comes as global experts gather in London to plot how to thwart catastrophic attacks that could kill thousands. Fears were high that a bomb attack would target the London Olympics this summer, Mr Burt will admit. Last month Senior Foreign Office Minister Baroness Warsi warned: ‘Nuclear  terrorism remains one of the greatest threats to our global peace and security. ‘A successful attack, no matter where in the world it came, would be catastrophic.’ The Foreign Office is working with dozens of countries to bolster the UN Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. The convention allows for international cooperation in the investigation, prosecution and extradition of anyone plotting terrorist acts involving radioactive material or a nuclear device.","Minister Alistair Burt uses speech to warn nuclear terrorism, once unthinkable, is now a real possibility .

"Jailed: Dayle Leatherland has pleaded guilty to benefits fraud and been sentenced to six months in prison at Wolverhampton Crown Court . A benefits cheat claimed he was so disabled he could not work - but in fact he was working as a security guard, patrolling large sites with his rottweiler dogs. Dayle Leatherland falsely claimed £34,000 from the taxpayer by pretending he could walk no more than 10 yards with the aid of a stick, and needed help getting in and out of bed or up and down stairs. However, investigators discovered that he played an active role running his own guard dog company, and he was spotted patrolling sites on foot with enormous rottweilers. Leatherland, 51, was paid a total of £33,924 in incapacity benefit, disability living allowance and income support which he was not entitled to. He was jailed for six months at Wolverhampton Crown Court after pleading guilty to six charges of benefit fraud. The court heard Leatherland filled in self-assessment forms claiming he was so severely disabled he couldn't tie his own shoe laces. His six-year scam was exposed in May 2013, after it was discovered he ran a business called D. Leatherland Dog Handling Services from his home in Tipton, West Midlands. DWP investigators also found details that he had been employed by companies to guard sites and patrol with his dog at locations up to 60 miles from his home. Prosecutor Mark Jackson said: 'He claimed the consequences of numerous physical problems were that he could only walk a few steps very slowly before feeling severe discomfort. 'He said his ankle would give way causing him to stumble. The picture he presented was one of acute physical difficulty and he was categorised as being virtually unable to walk. 'This was completely incompatible with the reality of him running his own business as a security guard specialising in dog handling. If officials had known the true situation he would not have had any benefit at all.' Adrian Stephens, defending, said he had built up debts of £56,000 while installing a conservatory and adding an extension to his home. Fraud: Leatherland was in fact running his own business as a handler for rottweiler guard dogs . He added: 'Operations are still being carried out to correct deformities. He then got work he felt he could do and he either misunderstood the situation or turned a blind eye. 'He was focused on these very severe debts and this was a way of paying some of them. There was no lavish lifestyle, luxury holidays or fast cars. He did what he did to clear his debts, he made the wrong choices.'

"The controversial hike would go ahead despite the Prime Minister's warning that the increase would be 'completely unacceptable' MPs are likely to incur public fury with an inflation-busting ten per cent pay rise next year – an increase supported by the new head of Parliament's expenses watchdog. The plan will see annual pay rise from £67,060 to £74,000, as predicted by The Mail on Sunday in May last year. But Marcial Boo, who took up his post as chief executive of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority in June, insisted: 'It is not an excessive amount of money at all.' He is reported to have said the controversial hike would go ahead despite the Prime Minister's warning that the increase would be 'completely unacceptable'. Mr Boo said politicians should not be paid a 'miserly amount' for their important job and their salaries needed to 'catch up' with their counterparts overseas. But the proposal is likely to meet with outrage at a time when public sector workers' wage rises have been capped at one per cent. In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, Mr Boo said: 'This is an important job, the job of an MP. They are there to represent us all, to form laws, to send young people to war. It is not an easy thing to do. We want to have good people doing the job and they need to be paid fairly. 'Now, that's not paid in excess but it's not being paid a miserly amount either ... 'It's our job to reach the judgment of what the right amount is. There are lots and lots of professionals in public life and in the private sector who earn a lot more than that - so it is not an excessive amount of money at all.' MPs are already due a one per cent increase to £67,731 next April, and under Ipsa's plan is will rise again a month later to £74,000. The watchdog has said it will conduct one further review of the pay rise after the election - as it is legally obliged to do - but Mr Boo made clear its conclusions were unlikely to shift. 'We were allowing for any change in economic circumstances,' he said. 'At that time we had only just emerged from recession, it wasn't quite clear we were going to have the growth that we have got now as a country, so we left the option open to change the position. 'As of now, September, it doesn't look like there is any major economic factor that would change the determination that we reached in 2013.' He added: 'Parliament as a whole has created an independent body to set MPs' pay. We have gone through the process in a really rigorous way. It is not an arbitrary figure that we have come up with. 'Obviously, it is for parliament to decide whether they want to take back responsibility for setting their own pay. I don't believe that's right. Scroll down for video . MPs are already due a one per cent increase to £67,731 next April, and under Ipsa's plan is will rise again a month later to £74,000 . 'I think we are in a better position as a country now when we have an independent, transparent regulator that is tasked with determining MPs' remuneration. 'This is the number that we've come up with and we talked both to the public and to MPs about it. But if Parliament wants to change its mind and to change our remit then that's clearly for them.' Mr Boo - whose own £120,000 salary is £10,000 more than that of his predecessor - insisted a change in the law would be needed to prevent Ipsa following through on its proposals. Another potential block to the pay rise was removed over the summer, when Ipsa chairman Sir Ian Kennedy was reappointed for another 18 months - meaning he will remain in post after the general election.","Increase is supported by the new head of Parliament's expenses watchdog .

"A green-fingered pensioner's attempt to grow shrubs and flowers in his front garden has spectacularly back-fired - after the foliage grew so fast it engulfed his entire house. Colin Melbourne's £240,000 semi-detached property in posh Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, has become consumed by rampant ivy and conifers, leaving it invisible to passers-by. His front garden is so overrun with plants the windows, front door and even the garage are hidden beneath the sprawling greenery. Scroll down for video . The £240,000 home in posh Leamington Spa has become almost invisible to passers-by due to sprawling ivy . Neighbours would help pensioner tame his unruly garden if asked but think owner is 'probably too proud to ask' Residents who live near Mr Melbourne, 78, are now urging the council to help him bring his wayward garden back under control. One resident, who did not want to be named, said: 'Mr Melbourne lives in the house and has done for many years. 'He is often seen planting flowers and shrubs but the weather this year has sent them skyward. 'He is a character and usually puts his plants in bags before transferring them into his garden. One resident said that the good weather this year has sent the green-fingered pensioner's foliage up to the sky . 'The front garden has also been a bit unruly but this summer the good weather has sent the ivy and conifers shooting up. 'The house is so hidden you can't even see the front door. 'I feel sorry for the people living directly next door because their home is very nicely kept and has recently been repainted. Another local said it was unfair for neighours who take care of their home but live next to the unsightly foliage . 'I hate to say it but the house has become a bit of an eyesore and the council really should take some action if for no other reason than to help Mr Melbourne control his plants. 'It must be really depressing living like that, it must be very gloomy inside.' Another neighbour added: 'Mr Melbourne is no trouble to us or anyone on the street. 'His efforts to improve his garden have clearly got away from him and we'd all happily help him if he wanted us to but I daresay he's too proud to ask.' Mr Melbourne took up gardening after retiring from his job as a market trader. Neighbour and friend Trudy Dickson, 50, who has known him for 20 years, said: 'Colin is a lovely man and a real character. 'He used to run a market stall in Coventry selling women's handbags. His front room was always full of stock and he used to put flowers in the bags which he couldn't sell. 'No one minds that his garden is overgrown, it is a bit of a local landmark and probably wouldn't be the same if he cut it all down. 'He is a character but very generous. When we held a street party for the Queen's Jubilee he gave a very generous donation and came out and chatted to everybody. He was charming.

"For climate change activists, this week was marked by an 'I-told-you-so' moment after a group of experts from around the world released their annual report indicating that the Earth is getting warmer. The State of the Climate in 2013 report, published online Thursday by the American Meteorological Society, showed that greenhouse gases, sea levels, global temperatures and other key climate indicators were all on the rise last year. The report, compiled by 425 scientists from 57 countries around the world, provides a detailed update on global climate indicators, notable weather events, and other data collected by environmental monitoring stations and instruments on air, land, sea, and ice. New high: The levels of CO2 at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii hit 400 parts per million for the first time in 2013 . Stark contrast: With rising air and sea temperatures, mountain glaciers continue shrinking. Pictured here is Italy's Careser Glacier in 1933 (top) and 2012 (bottom) ‘These findings reinforce what scientists for decades have observed: that our planet is becoming a warmer place,’ said NOAA Administrator Kathryn Sullivan. ‘This report provides the foundational information we need to develop tools and services for communities, business, and nations to prepare for, and build resilience to, the impacts of climate change.’ Climatologists point a finger of blame at record-breaking levels of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, which are responsible for trapping heat inside the Earth's atmosphere making the surface of the planet warmer. Emissions that come from burning fossils fuels reached historic highs last year, according to the report. The levels of CO2 at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii hit 400 parts per million for the first time in 2013 - and these changes did not go unnoticed. In Australia, 2013 was the hottest year on record, while in Argentina and New Zealand it was the second and third warmest, respectively. Balmy: Sea surface temperature in 2013 compared to the 1981-2010 average. The dark red and blue areas reveal areas of the global ocean that were up to 4º Fahrenheit warmer or cooler than average. Inching up: The map shows where average sea level in 2013 was above or below its long-term average. Places where sea level rose up to 8 inches higher than the 1993-2010 average are dark blue, average levels are white, and places where sea level fell below average are brown . Hotspots: Earth surface temperatures in 2013 compared to the 1981-2010 average . Air temperature around the world was among the balmiest since record-keeping began in 1880, with 2013 ranked between second and sixth hottest, depending on methods of calculation used by different groups of scientists. As a result of melting ice sheets and warmer temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, sea levels continued rising at a steady pace, adding another one eighth of an inch from the year before. There was also more bad news for polar bears as the arctic sea ice extent continued to decline while temperatures over land in the region climbed faster than anywhere else on the planet. For example, the city of Fairbanks, Alaska, saw 36 days of temperatures above 80 degrees last summer. There were more examples of extreme weather events in 2013, like the deadly Super Typhoon Haiyan, which devastated portions of Southeast Asia in November. Disaster roundup: From devastating cyclones to crippling drought, this map highlights the events that climate scientists from around the world have concluded should go down in the record books as the year's most significant . The monster storm had the highest wind speed ever recorded for a tropical cyclone at 196mph. In addressing the bleak climate trends laid out in the report, Tom Karl, director of the National Climatic Data Center, compared Earth to a person trying to maintain their weight, only to add a couple more pounds each year, LiveScience reported. 'We are continuing to see ourselves put on more weight from year to year,' Karl said during a press conference Thursday.","State of the Climate in 2013 report by American Meteorological Society showed greenhouse gases, sea levels, global temperatures were on rise .

"As people across Australia relaxed after a day of festive over indulgence, one man was enduring perhaps the most miserable Christmas Day ever after becoming stranded on his jetski in the middle of a lake. The 28-year-old experienced jetskier had set off for a simple 4.5km ride on Lake Hume on the Victorian/New South Wales border, near his hometown of Albury, when his Christmas day went drastically wrong. The man’s friends become worried and reported him missing to police after he failed to return from the 15-minute ride by 8.00pm after setting off at 6.30pm. Lake Hume Coast Guard set out to rescue the man on Boxing Day after he was located after spending 12 hours on the lake overnight . He spent the whole night in the middle of the lake, shivering on his jet ski, after it broke down and was miraculously rescued 12 hours later at 6.40am on Boxing Day. After being spotted by his friends, Lake Hume Coast Guard set out to retrieve him and his jet ski. Lake Hume Coast Guard Deputy Commander, Kevin Ellison, told Daily Mail Australia: ‘He was found this morning and he was reasonably well… He'd been out in the cold all night.’ The 28-year-old experienced jetskier had set off for a simple 4.5km ride on Lake Hume . His jet ski floated to the middle of Lake Hume after its engine broke down . The local man from Albury, NSW, is said to be in good spirits after being rescued .

"Washington (CNN) -- A new national poll suggests that as President Barack Obama prepares to try to convince a skeptical American public why the U.S. should take military action against Syria, he may be partly to blame for the box he's put himself into. The CNN/ORC poll released Tuesday indicates that Americans are divided evenly on whether Obama is a strong leader as well as whether he's honest and trustworthy. ""One concern is the messenger himself,"" CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. ""The public's split right down the middle on whether Obama is a strong leader, whether he is honest and trustworthy, and whether he inspires confidence."" Obama tells CNN a 'breakthrough' is possible on Syria . And the poll also found that only one in five say they completely understand Obama's Syria policy. A little more than half said they ""somewhat"" understand the administration's game plan and about three in 10 said they are not very clear, or don't understand at all, the administration's strategy. Obama will get the opportunity to explain the policy directly to the American people when he addresses the nation at 9 p.m. ET Tuesday. CNN Poll: Most don't approve of how Obama is handling foreign policy . War weariness is also partly to blame, the poll suggests â€” six in 10 say the Iraq war was a mistake and about half say the same thing about the war in Afghanistan. As a result, three-quarters say the U.S. shouldn't play the role of world policeman. ""The president's challenge is profound, both from a personal and from a policy standpoint,"" said CNN Chief National Correspondent John King. ""Personally the country is split on their opinion of the president, and from a policy perspective they have huge doubts right now."" Polls released on Monday showed that more than seven in 10 Americans said a strike would not achieve significant goals and a similar number said they didn't see how a strike on Syria would serve the national interest. A majority opposes Congress passing a resolution that would give Obama the authority to launch military operations against the regime of Bashar al-Assad, which Obama says is responsible for a chemical weapons attack on civilians that killed more than 1,000 people. CNN Poll: Most don't want Obama to attack Syria . Members of Congress say they're hearing that opposition from their constituents. While most members of the House and Senate say they're undecided on how they'll vote, the number of those who have made up their mind they will vote against it by far outnumber those who say they'll vote for it. The president is also up against the fact that Syria is nowhere near the top issue for most Americans. ""Syria may be the topic 24/7 on Capitol Hill and at the White House, but nearly three times as many Americans say the economy's the country's top issue than say the same about Syria,"" Holland added. The poll was conducted for CNN by ORC International September 6-8, with 1,022 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points.","Americans are evenly divided on Obama leadership qualities and whether he's trustworthy .

A record-breaking wide receiver for Boston College is giving up a chance at playing in the NFL to become a U.S. Navy SEAL. Alex Amidon, a 22-year-old senior from Greenfield, Massachusetts, smashed the school's records for the most receiving yards and was ranked 11th in the country for most receiving yards in 2012. The college paper, the BC Interruption, noted that his announcement at a football dinner on Wednesday night came as 'a shock'.

'To be honest, I never really gave the . records much thought during the season and I still haven't,' Amidon told The Republican in January. 'Perhaps a little further down the line . I'll reflect on them and what it all means, but I'm not at that point . yet.'

"Inspectors are looking into the cause of a coal slurry spill in West Virginia's eastern Kanawha County after it blackened six miles of a creek, officials with the state Department of Environmental Protection said Tuesday. More than 100,000 gallons of the coal slurry is believed to have flowed into Fields Creek, a tributary of the Kanawha River, officials said. Inspectors are testing the water to determine exactly how much leaked into the creek, the officials said. The spill at Patriot Coal was caused when a valve inside a slurry line malfunctioned, the state environmental protection officials said. Containment efforts by Patriot Coal began immediately, and cleanup activities are underway, said Janine Orf, a vice president at Patriot Coal. State EPA spokesman Tom Aluise said the water in the county was safe to drink, though West Virginia American Water has a ""do not use"" alert in place for pregnant women in the Kanawha Valley after an unrelated January 9 spill. Federal grand jury investigates West Virginia chemical spill . Word of the slurry spill comes as West Virginia is trying to recover from the January spill that leaked  4-methylcyclohexane methanol, known as MCHM, into the water. The chemical, used to wash coal before it goes to market in order to reduce ash, leaked into the Elk River and from there into Charleston's water supply on January 9. The result was a do-not-use order that left about 300,000 people in the area unable to drink or bathe in their water, some for more than a week. MCHM is so strong that it can be picked up even if there is no detectable amount in the water. That news continues to be of concern to residents, including U.S. Sen. Jay Rockefeller. ""I wouldn't drink that water if you paid me,"" he said on NPR's ""All Things Considered"" this week. When asked why, he said: ""Well, because it -- nobody has said that it's safe.""

"The have been dubbed 'Google Glass for skiers' and mean you'll never lose a friend (or miss a text message) on the slopes again. Oakley has being showing off its $500 Airwave 1.5 smart goggles at the Sundance Film Festival. The new model allows users to check their Facebook status from the gadget - and even respond mid-descent. Scroll down for video . Ski-tech: Oakley's Airwave goggles let you read emails on the slopes, as well as listen to music, make phone calls via a connection and study piste maps . Pilot style screen: The £500 goggles have a head-up display which show a skier's speed, location, altitude and distance travelled . The Googles have a fighter pilot-style screen on the inside of the lens, displaying a skier’s speed, location, altitude and distance travelled as they zoom down the slopes. The goggles can also connect to an iPhone or Android phone or tablet, transmitting incoming calls to an earpiece. Text messages or Facebook updates can be beamed straight onto the screen in front of the skier’s eyes. Users can play music stored on their phone, flicking through playlists with a wireless controller worn on the wrist. An accompanying Airwave app allows skiers or snowboarders to choose from 600 resort piste maps, and includes a ‘buddy’ setting to track friends or relatives on the slopes. The technology harnesses the power of the latest generation of smartphones, utilising the gadgets’ GPS, communications and entertainment technology and transferring it onto the surface of the goggles via Bluetooth. Data is shown on a display in the corner of the skier’s vision, with the effect of viewing a 14-inch screen from 5ft away. 'The new Airwave has an improved processing speed, and about a 30-35 percent increase in battery life,' Oakley's Product Category Manager, Chris Petrillo, told FoxNews. 'It's like driving your car, you look at the windshield every once or glance down to look at your speed. He said the most popular feature was the buddy tracking system. 'Your friends will show up on the map so you know exactly where they are,' 'People really seem to love that.' Oakley chief executive Colin Baden said at the launch of the first version: ‘Airwave represents the power and possibility of technology.’ Mr Baden said the Heads Up technology - which could possibly be adapted to fit into sunglasses - had been 15 years in the making. ‘As an organisation, we’ve been chasing this beast since 1997,’ he said earlier this year. ‘Ultimately, everything happens through your eyes, and the closer we can bring it to your eyes, the quicker the consumer is going to adopt the platform.’ Hand controls: The goggles come with a controller worn on the wrist that allows a user to flick through playlists and songs as they ski .","Device dubbed 'Google Glass for skiers'

"LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Guantanamo Bay's legacy of torture will hurt the United States even if President Obama makes good on a pledge to close the prison camp, a former inmate says. Moazzam Begg says that during intense interrogations at Guantanamo Bay, he would have confessed to anything. Justice will be impossible to mete out to the alleged terrorists and war criminals held there because any confessions must be tainted by the methods used to obtain them, ex-prisoner Moazzam Begg told CNN. Begg says he would have confessed to anything during interrogations while he was held at Guantanamo for nearly three years. ""What procedure can you use on people who have been systematically tortured including waterboarding, including being stripped naked and beaten? What sort of evidence can be admitted into a court of law that has been extracted under that process?"" asked Begg.  Watch what Begg thinks of Guantanamo » . The new administration  has said that waterboarding, which causes the feeling of drowning, is torture. Begg, who is British, was captured during the war in Afghanistan and accused of aiding the Taliban regime.  His family has always maintained he was a victim of mistaken identity. He was sent back to his home in Britain by the Bush administration in 2005 and never prosecuted. President Obama on Wednesday moved closer to making good on his campaign promise. The administration is drafting executive orders calling for the detention facility's closure, officials said. Earlier in the day, a judge granted Obama's request for a 120-day suspension of prosecutions so a review of all cases of suspected terrorists could take place. During his inaugural speech, he stressed that ideals of justice did not need to be thrown out to ensure the nation's safety. ""Our Founding Fathers, faced with perils we can scarcely imagine, drafted a charter to assure the rule of law and the rights of man, a charter expanded by the blood of generations. Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience's sake,"" Obama said.  Watch what could be next for Guantanamo » . Legal issues are already complicating the cases of some of the most important terror suspects, like Mohamed al-Qahtani, the so-called 20th hijacker, who has been accused of helping to plan and possibly participate in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Earlier this month, the retired judge in charge of determining which Guantanamo detainees should be tried by a U.S. military commission told The Washington Post that al-Qahtani was tortured and therefore could not  be put forward for prosecution. ""Guantanamo Bay is the most notorious prison on earth,"" Begg said. He said he believes Guantanamo is a radicalizing force for militants around the world. Looking beyond high-profile suspects, human rights campaigners say there is little evidence to prosecute dozens of Guantanamo inmates still being held. They argue that keeping those detainees locked up will not help keep al Qaeda at bay. ""I think it's actually one of the most harmful myths about it, that we can't let people go because we've got the tiger by the tail,"" said Cori Crider of the human rights organization Reprieve. Chris Arendt, a former guard at Guantanamo Bay, says the Obama administration must rethink and reform the way it detains and prosecutes future terror suspects -- and do more than just close Guantanamo. ""We're focused on this one camp that has become the star of the whole show. But there are camps everywhere,"" he said. ""There are camps in Iraq, in Afghanistan -- every country that American or the coalition forces have set their feet. None of those detainees are seeing any justice.""","NEW: Obama administration drafting executive orders calling for camp's closure .

"Jose Mourinho says skipper John Terry is 'guaranteed' to stay at Chelsea next season. Terry is out of contract in the summer, but terms over a new 12-month deal are close to be being agreed.

John Terry will sign a new contract with Chelsea to stay at the club for another year, Jose Mourinho confirmed .

Mourinho's words come after Terry spoke out about his bid to earn a new deal at Stamford Bridge . Terry has a word with Mourinho as they embrace on the Wembley pitch after winning the Capital One Cup . When asked about when his captain's contract situation would be sorted on Tuesday, Mourinho said: 'Yes, it will be before the end of the season for sure. 'What I can guarantee is he will be a Chelsea player next season. I can guarantee that. 'To guarantee that, it's because I know what my board tell me and what the player tells me. No doubts he is going to get his contract, no doubts. I think it's around that (terms agreed but not signed).' Mourinho's words come after Terry spoke out following the Capital One Cup final about his bid to earn a new deal at Stamford Bridge. Mourinho was certain that Terry was going to be part of his squad for the 2015-16 Premier League season . Mourinho and Terry pose together with the Capital One Cup at Wembley Stadium on Sunday .

'I am fighting for myself and my family, and to prove people wrong,' he said. 'It doesn't come much bigger than that. I want to give it everything. 'I don't know how long I have left. Hopefully I have a few years left but if this is my last year then I hope it will go out on a bang. The Chelsea boss could bring Kurt Zouma into midfield again in the absence of Nemanja Matic .

Mourinho refused to confirm whether Kurt Zouma would again start in midfield against West Ham on Wednesday with Nemanja Matic and John Obi Mikel both still out through suspension and injury respectively. 'I don't play same team (as at Wembley), that's for sure,' Mourinho said. 'He (Zouma) is not a midfield player. He is not going to be a midfielder. That is completely clear. It's not his future. 'But the team is better when you know the qualities of everybody, when you know everybody can be extra in some details, and if Zouma couldn't do that for us on that day, we would have been in trouble.'

"(CNN) -- The stepfather of a missing Maryland boy was charged Thursday with first-degree murder after the boy's mother was found dead, police said. Curtis Lopez, 45, was arrested Thursday morning in Charlotte, North Carolina, after a warrant was issued, said Chief Tom Manger of the Montgomery County, Maryland, police.

""Our focus and our priority now is locating William McQuain,"" Manger told reporters Thursday. He held up two pictures of the sixth-grader, one a class picture and the other showing him in a baseball uniform. The case began Wednesday afternoon when a friend of the boy's mother reported her missing, saying he had not seen her for about two weeks and that he was concerned for her welfare, Manger said. Police learned her son had not been in school since Sept. 30. When detectives arrived at the woman's home in Germantown, they found Jane McQuain, 51, dead in her bedroom with evidence of trauma to her upper body, Manger said. Her son was not there and the woman's vehicle, a Honda CRV, was gone. Lopez was McQuain's husband and had been known to frequent her residence but did not appear to live there, Manger said. Witnesses told police they saw him recently at the home, removing property and loading it into McQuain's Honda, he said. The car was found Thursday morning, but police would not reveal where. Detectives contacted Lopez on Wednesday night, before they found McQuain's body, Manger said. Once the body was found and the case was ruled a homicide, Lopez, based on his inconsistent statements, became a person of interest, he said. ""We were hoping that we would find (William) with Mr. Lopez and we did not, so we are asking for the public's help in locating 11-year-old William McQuain,"" Manger said. ""My hope is that he may be with a family member or a friend that perhaps has no idea what's occurred with his mother, but as time goes on it becomes, I guess, more and more of a long shot that that's the case,"" he said. Jane McQuain was probably dead for 10 to 12 days before police found her, Manger said. Police believe Lopez may have had a residence in North Carolina, Capt. Paul Starks of the Montgomery County police told CNN, but they have few other details linking him to the area. William McQuain is described as a light-skinned African-American, about 5 feet tall and weighing about 85 pounds. Anyone with information on his whereabouts is urged to call 911, police said. CNN's Brittany Kaplan contributed to this report.","NEW: Police charge boy's stepfather with murder of his mother .

"By . Harriet Arkell . Ojuri 'Charles' Adesanya, 29, from Chafford Hundred, Essex, persuaded jewellery designers to hand over gems worth £367,949 using a forged letter from Harper's Bazaar China . A celebrity stylist who stole more than £30,000 worth of gems from Mick Jagger's jewellery designer daughter is today facing jail. Ojuri 'Charles' Adesanya, 29, pocketed the bespoke jewellery from Jade Jagger after claiming it would be used for a bogus fashion shoot in women's magazine, Harpers Bazaar China. Adesanya used the same ruse to dupe aristocratic designer Celia Weinstock into handing over more than £143,000 of jewels, using a forged letter from a previous genuine commission from the fashion magazine to secure the handmade gems. Adesanya, whose clients include boy band JLS and Golden Globe winning actress Jessica Chastain, swindled jewellery worth a total of £367,949 - including £129,700 from Frost of London; £55,835 from EC1 Jewellers, and £8,555 from designer Kristjan Eyjolfsson. He then pawned the items for a fraction of their value in a bid to clear mounting debts, Southwark Crown Court heard . He appeared in the dock at Southwark Crown Court today smartly dressed in a black suit and tie and spoke only to confirm his identity and plead guilty to five counts of fraud and four further counts of theft. The scam took place between August 6 2013 and May 7 2013. A further fraud count in relation to procurement of a £3,000 suit from top designer Alexander McQueen, using the same method, is likely to be left on the court file. Adesanya, from Chafford Hundred, Grays, Essex, had initially denied the charges and had been due to stand trial in May. Adjourning sentencing for reports, Judge Alistair McCreath released Adesanya on bail but warned him that all options were open when he returned for sentencing on 28 July. 'You need to fully understand that I'm not deciding on the right sentence today,' he said.  'No decision that I have made today has any bearing on what sentence you are going to get... 'These are serious offences and the court will be thinking seriously about the right sentence.' On his website, Adesanya boasts of being a 'cutting edge stylist' who jet-sets between New York, Paris, London and Los Angeles. Adesanya stole gems worth £30,000 from Jade Jagger, right, the jewellery designer daughter of Mick Jagger . Also listed among his clients are Petra Ecclestone, Camilla Alves, the model wife of actor Matthew McConaughey; DJ Nick Grimshaw and Grey's Anatomy star, Jesse Williams. Adesanya has also styled musicians including The Voice star Vince Kidd and singer/songwriter Patrick Wolf. Prosecutor Nina Ellin told the court: 'The defendant was working as a stylist in the fashion industry. 'The letter relates to jewellery being borrowed for a particular photoshoot for a particular commission of the magazine. 'There was no photoshoot that was legislation in the context of this indictment. 'He had cash flow difficulties and decided to pawn some of the goods.  He accepts that in doing so he was acting dishonestly.' Adesanya eventually returned some of the jewellery six months later - but only after being urged to by a judge, Ms Ellin said.  Ms Weinstock has since received £82,000 worth of the missing gems. Defending, Charles Royle said: 'He found himself in difficulties and made poor choices. 'He perhaps hasn't had the most sensible reaction, he has rather hidden away from his problems.'","Ojuri 'Charles' Adesanya, 29, styled stars including JLS and Jessica Chastain .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 20:57 EST, 13 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 21:02 EST, 13 November 2013 . Heart failure that kills thousands of Brits every year could be cured by a simple jab which shrinks the vital organ, according to a new study. Scientists who have reversed the condition in animals by injecting them with a gene now hope tests on patients will be just as successful. They found the ‘SUMO-1’ gene therapy can shrink enlarged hearts, improving their function and increasing blood flow. Heart failure happens when the heart is unable to pump blood adequately. It affects over 750,000 people in the UK - mainly the elderly - and claims 140,000 lives a year. The ¿SUMO-1¿ gene therapy can shrink enlarged hearts, improving their function and increasing blood flow. There are treatments but no cure. In the final experiments before human clinical trials SUMO-1, a gene which is 'missing in action' in heart failure patients, was delivered directly into the organ. Dr Roger Hajjar, who led the study, said: 'SUMO-1 gene therapy may be one of the first treatments that can actually shrink enlarged hearts and significantly improve a damaged heart’s life-sustaining function. 'We are very eager to test this gene therapy in our patients suffering from severe heart failure.' Dr Hajjar is already on a path toward approval from the Food and Drug Administration in the US to test the revolutionary treatment on patients. It will be the second gene therapy treatment launched by he and his colleagues at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. The first, named CUPID, is in its final phases after successful tests on animals and substantial clinical improvements in patients. In that project, a gene known as SERCA2 which produces an enzyme critical to the proper pumping of calcium out of cells, is injected via a harmless virus. In heart failure SERCA2 is dysfunctional forcing the heart to work harder and in the process grow larger. The virus carrying SERCA2 is delivered through the coronary arteries into the heart using tiny tubes. Studies show only one dose is required to restore healthy production of the gene’s beneficial enzyme. But a study by Dr Hajjar and his researchers published two years ago showed SUMO-1 is also decreased in failing human hearts. The injection could reduce the need for invasive heart surgery, scientists hope . Dr Hajjar said: 'The key reason for this translational medicine speed is the outstanding infrastructure we have in the Cardiovascular Research Centre at Mount Sinai where we are able to replicate human heart failure models to test our novel gene therapies. 'I think this is a really very unique example of rapid translation of a promising medical therapy from an initial discovery to pre-clinical trials.'","Researchers have successfully tested the injection on animals .

"By . Alex Finnis For Mail Online . Eric Silverman is breathing a sigh of relief after doctors told him they believe his Ebola scare is actually just malaria . The Brooklyn man who was quarantined in New York and suspected to have been infected with Ebola probably just has malaria. Humanitarian worker Eric Silverman, 27, had just returned from a four-month stint in Sierra Leone, where he was doing farming and building work, when he started developing symptoms similar to those shown by Ebola victims. When Mr Silverman initially tested negative for malaria he became terrified that he may have the killer disease, but now it turns out that he probably does have malaria after all. Mr Silverman returned to New York on July 17 for his mother's birthday, and developed severe stomach pains and high fever two weeks later. To go with the diarrhoea, sore throat and headaches, he was quarantined in Manhattan's Mount Sinai Hospital and had to deal with the fearful prospect that he may be the latest victim of the untreatable disease. He was kept in an isolated glass box for more than 72 hours, as Americans all over the country feared the disease had spread to their shores, but an infectious disease doctor has now told him that all the evidence suggests he has malaria - a disease he had already contracted back in February. 'I've been taking a lot of medicine, and so that kind of might have interfered, and so they couldn't spot any malaria in my blood work, but it could still be there,' Silverman told CBS New York. Scroll down for video . Mr Silverman (right), a 27-year-old Brooklyn grad student who returned from Sierra Leone in July, was  quarantined at Mount Sinai Medical Center after complaining of symptoms all too familiar to Ebola victims . Mr Silverman was known as 'Ebola Patient Zero' all over America, and he told the New York Daily News: 'Even my friends didn’t believe me when I told them I was the mystery patient. They thought I was joking.' Mr Silverman plans to return to Sierra Leone to continue his humanitarian work . He recounted how he first fell ill: 'I turned up the heat in the car to 90 degrees and drove back to Brooklyn — then I got out of the car and I was freezing again. 'My mother took my temperature and it was 104. When she called our family doctor, she said to get me to the emergency room at Mount Sinai.' Silverman's nurse, Margaret Kraus, compared the next 72 hours to the night the hospital went on overdrive to house extra patients forced to evacuate another hospital during Hurricane Sandy. 'If he had the Ebola virus, we all knew how it could impact so many people’s lives,' she said. Now that he has been given the all-clear, Mr Silverman plans to return to Sierra Leone to continue his humanitarian work once the Ebola outbreak has cleared up. The virus claimed its first European victim on Monday, when 75-year-old Spanish priest Miguel Pajares died five days after being airlifted from Liberia to Madrid for expert care. The overall death toll is now at 1,069 people, and with it continuing to rise with no signs of stopping, the World Health Organisation declared it ethical to use untested drugs to attempt to control it.","Eric Silverman, 27, was quarantined in a New York hotel for three days .

"(CNN) -- Uganda's government institutions will lose U.S. funding as punishment for a law signed earlier this year by President Yoweri Museveni that makes some homosexual acts punishable by life in prison. In addition, the White House said Thursday that Washington will cancel a planned military exercise with Uganda and deny entry to certain Ugandan citizens, including those ""involved in serious human rights abuses, including against LGBT individuals."" The United States will not end its humanitarian support for Uganda or its cooperation to stamp out the Lord's Resistance Army, led by the elusive Joseph Kony. ""We will seek to advance these interests even as we continue -- in Uganda and around the world -- to oppose discriminatory practices and champion human rights for all,"" read the statement by White House National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden. Uganda's anti-homosexuality act, first introduced in 2009, originally included a death penalty clause for some such acts. It was briefly shelved when Britain and other European nations threatened to withdraw aid to Uganda, which relies on millions of dollars from the international community. Museveni signed the bill into law in February, two months after Uganda's Parliament passed it after replacing a death penalty provision with a proposal of life in prison for ""aggravated homosexuality."" This includes acts in which one person is infected with HIV, ""serial offenders"" and sex with minors, according to Amnesty International. The law calls for the imprisonment of those who counsel or reach out to gays and lesbians -- a provision that would ensnare rights groups and others providing services to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Museveni's position on the law changed several times before he signed it. At one point, he said he wouldn't sign the bill, describing homosexuals as ""sick"" people who needed help, not imprisonment. He said he changed his mind after scientists had determined that there is no gene for homosexuality and that it is merely a choice to embrace abnormal behavior. Museveni told CNN in February that he believes sexual behavior is a matter of choice and gay people are ""disgusting."" Ugandan granted bail in first gay sex trial since tough new law .

"The Scotland Yard investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann is 'moving forward', a top officer has revealed. British detectives have issued a new request for help to their Portuguese counterparts in a bid to discover what happened to the youngster. It comes amid reports that police are closing in on three 'prime suspects' believed to have been involved in the toddler's disappearance. 'Moving forward': British detectives have issued a new request for help to their Portuguese counterparts in a bid to discover what happened to Madeleine McCann (pictured), who went missing in Praia da Luz in May 2007 . Inquiry: Deputy Assistant Commissioner Martin Hewitt, right, said Scotland Yard had sent a third international letter of request to Portuguese officials. Left, Madeleine was nearly four years old when she disappeared . Today, Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant . Commissioner Martin Hewitt, who is overseeing the operation, said police . had sent a third international letter of request to Portuguese . officials. 'Clearly the . investigative tempo is moving forward as we're progressing the . investigation and the work that we're asking the Portuguese to undertake . for us,' he said. 'We sent a further detailed letter of request which went out from the Crown Prosecution Service on Friday. 'This is part of an ongoing process. We are carrying on our liaison at all levels.' Emotional: Kate and Gerry McCann give a press conference about their daughter following her disappearance . Scene: Madeleine went missing from the Ocean Club (pictured) as her parents dined at a nearby restaurant . He added that further letters of request would be sent to Portugal on a 'routine' basis as the probe gathers pace. Meanwhile, Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, who is leading the hunt for Madeleine, has travelled to Portugal this week to meet senior officers in the Algarve. Last month, three prime suspects in Madeleine's disappearance were identified by Scotland Yard officers. Analysis of mobile phone data suggested a burglary gang was operating very near to where she vanished in Portugal in May 2007. Meeting: Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood (pictured), who is leading the hunt for Madeleine, has travelled to Portugal this week to meet senior officers in the Algarve . The three men made an unusually high number of calls to each other in the hours after Madeleine was reported missing from her holiday flat. Police are believed to be closing in on the thieves, including at least one Portuguese man, who had already carried out one raid in the resort of Praia da Luz, according to the Daily Express. However, the Met Police has refused to comment on the reports  - with Mr Hewitt claiming no requests for interviews or arrests have been made so far. Madeleine, who was then nearly four, disappeared from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in the Algarve on May 3, 2007, as her parents dined at a nearby restaurant with friends. British detectives launched a fresh investigation into the youngster's disappearance in July last year - two years into a review of the case - and made renewed appeals on television in the UK, the Netherlands and Germany. After shelving their inquiry into Madeleine's disappearance in 2008, Portuguese authorities said last October that a review had uncovered enough new information to justify reopening it. Today, Scotland Yard stressed that the third international letter of request is a routine part of the inquiry - and would not reveal what it said. Letters of request are typically used to ask the Portuguese police to carry out certain pieces of work on the British force's behalf. A spokesman for Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, told the newspaper that the latest request for help was 'a significant development' in the case.","Deputy Assistant .
